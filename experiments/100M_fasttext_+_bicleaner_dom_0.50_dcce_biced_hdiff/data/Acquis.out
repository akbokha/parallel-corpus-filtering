&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not agree , it can take the proceedings after paragraph 3 within two months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) Any request to change the list according to the letter a ) , b ) and c ) will be immediately displayed by the Swiss Watch Chamber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to this expertise , the institutes agree to take out watches or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community , which is sufficiently representative and comprises no more than 50 watches or movements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the control of these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and their possible proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customs authorities can , however , make their own customs closures if necessary for control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customs authorities take note of the cargo loading of a road vehicle , a lor@@ ry or container at a transit log or on the way , so they must note the newly created customs closures and the type of checks carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the instructions included in the article 24 and 35 , the instructions for using the Car@@ net TI@@ R procedure and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R shall remain un@@ affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for the entry into force of this convention are concluded and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) When the association is notified that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) The General Director , immediately noti@@ fies all Member States of the organization from any amendments to this convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification , that its procedures for entry into force are completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) This agreement remains in force for a long time , as the states contract party of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means agreement and protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify , as required in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core brit@@ tle bodies for unknown aims and the deter@@ rence of such bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reach the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , associated with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical completion of the re @-@ evaluation by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity , which is not shown for a given period , is specified for a specified period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when performing their ex@@ ams , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s safety system after article 3 full use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounting and control system of the Community for core material , according to this agreement , is based on a breakdown in material balance zones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying its backup measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following types of use and , as far as required , see how they are more determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the existing core material and quantities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) the assessment of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements , and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) procedures for determining , examining and evaluating differences in measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( e ) procedures for assessment of accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F ) a protocol and report system , which points to the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the input and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( g ) In@@ struc@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining , or in ore treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material ( which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet been reached in the States so that the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) leaves nuclear material suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase where it is produced , or else , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation process , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The provisions provided in this Convention are concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not possible or desirable , the organization and community consult each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) The provisions provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation exemp@@ t the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation exemp@@ t the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this Convention , provided that the total amount of core material delivered by this article is no longer at any time more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) The ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five fold square of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures following this Convention , so precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this agreement , in detail how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or am@@ ended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements will come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and states undertake every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the underlying core material contained in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organization ) on the other hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ rans@@ fer@@ encing problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement , and the funds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in which way it is intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the Member States have to contribute to the transaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; account is separated separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the Member State upon request to pay in the currency of the respective State by order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit office of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the appointed time ;
II ) The second in the amount of the remaining amount of the entry to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) If requested , any Member State can make payments in advance of the above dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional draw on cash or the school @-@ notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction in an appropriate manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when granting loans to the E@@ EC , the administrator can be guided by the following factors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit capacity to loan terms , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VII ) to the extent , in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly @-@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral asset ) , regardless of whether it is part of the process and practices financed by the organization funded by the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able for ten years in 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies by Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amounts to the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization , which reserves them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the bene@@ fici@@ ary and the administrator , in which particular the source of the funds is stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recei@@ pts from any transaction loan may be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services ( ii ) in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and according to what the administrator specified at the time of the loan granted the recipient of a special transaction loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are transferred to the special transaction , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until full disclosure of all special transaction loans , the administrator teaches the E@@ G about the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the ste@@ ward receives the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditure for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , with a statement of the external invoice audi@@ tor of the organization to this account completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the F@@ TT as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are from the account funds to financial obligations , which are evident from the account and the payments to the Member States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until full issue of the special transaction account provides an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of the programmes financed by special action loans and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement will not be entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation may agree , so the agreements and all obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the total capital amount of all loans taken by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedure concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications , along with a notification of the regular approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is in two sentences in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas the agreement in the form of an envelope to am@@ end the An@@ nex A of the Protocol no . 1 , the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is issued : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as Switzerland , represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation of a joint venture in accordance with Section V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work must be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary overl@@ app@@ ings and to speed up their respective research projects which have achieved higher priority levels due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement should enable every party party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , to achieve the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes in An@@ nex I and II , called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation within the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or am@@ ended in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each time the parties are accepting a new program , it will take the place of the programs listed in An@@ nex I and II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association defined in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present @-@ day states , as well as the laboratories carried out at the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of each programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it occurs when the parties have communicated to each other , that the necessary procedure has been carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is concluded for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme referred to in Article 1 , and is renewed in line with Eur@@ atom &apos;s further relevant programme resolutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extension for the duration of the new programme , which comes to the place of the Eur@@ atom programme , is valid for the extension of the programme listed in An@@ nex I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before each decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contracting parties refer to the organs of the present agreement in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of an exchange of letters to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the customs tariff in the future , it also appears that an article 12 may be included in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to confirm the consent of the Community for these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force on 1 January 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank you , if you would confirm the consent of your Government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to confirm the receipt of your present letter , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your Government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could include stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of payments paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already , here are some conditions called for which the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the opening of the loans and for any extension , the BC@@ CI would calculate a credit opening fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currencies would take place in the currencies available in the BC@@ CI , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which were to be dealt with taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z applies to under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the BC@@ CI has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate coming to the application could achieve a maximum , corresponding to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would appreciate if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could include stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks have a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to you to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the reasons : with the declaration of November 22 , 1973 ( 3 ) , an action programme of the European Communities for Environmental Protection was established , which was added to the resolution of 17 May 1977 ( 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settlement of the Convention by the Community is necessary to negotiate and conclude the regional agreements provided in this Convention , insofar as these agreements are to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Community according to Directive 79 / 40@@ 9 / EW@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the special situation of Greenland in terms of the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be excluded from the scope of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the realization that wild animals in their numerous manifestations form an irre@@ plac@@ eable part of the natural system of the earth , and must be preserved for the benefit of mankind ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the consciousness that every generation maintains the natural assets of the earth for the coming generations , and is committed to ensure that this legacy is preserved and where it is used to use it in a pru@@ dent manner ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing importance of wild animals from environmentally @-@ related , ecological , genetic , scientific , aesthetic , un@@ timely , cultural , educational , social and economic point of view ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular concern for the species of wild animals , the hikes over national borders or outside the same company ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognizing that states must be the prot@@ ector of the wandering animal species and must be , who live or pass through their national jurisdiction ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following yearly amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses weight ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the quantity actually executed does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form be possible following changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it is committed to ensure that Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set in Argentina under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , and this shall be taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ stone of exhaus@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb fl@@ esh@@ ly on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lamb is only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , particularly by awar@@ ding quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under the number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community , for its part , obli@@ ges to make all necessary precau@@ tions for the origin of import lic@@ ences related to the origin in Argentina on the basis of an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way , that it is possible to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for the issuing of the goods in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the execution provisions , the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community shall in regular intervals inform the quantities given for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to the country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement is not impaired by products made of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb and goat meat under the agreement not named after the Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement , irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties , shall apply within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the annual volume , which is set under number 2 , applies to the period from 1 January to 31 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount paid by this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in view of changes made by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform your Government &apos;s consent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I invite you to confirm the entrance of your present letter , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set in Argentina under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , and this shall be taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ stone of exhaus@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform your Government &apos;s consent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor my government &apos;s approval with the content of your letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on import of H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not com@@ promised after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , I honour the following agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand receives assurance that the normal he@@ el of its h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb , is not affected by the application of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity actually executed does not exceed the set amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above are carried out in the traditional forms of supply ( frozen , cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community &apos;s marketplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form be possible following changes in technology and trade , the two contracting parties should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the clause mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement , to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new Member States join New Zealand , the Community changes the amounts specified in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the in@@ feed charges for these new Member States shall be taken into account in accordance with the aforementioned sets of measures called in clause 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 is fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community of 2,@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development , which might affect normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb fl@@ esh@@ ly on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the shipments of intervention stocks on frozen meat are not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation of this objective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything in order to promote market stability in the community with no risk of market stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for ex@@ portation of sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand guarantees the observ@@ ance of the amounts specified in clause 2 in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community , for its part , obli@@ ges to make all necessary precau@@ tions for the origin of import lic@@ ences related to the origin in New Zealand on the basis of an export license issued by the competent authority named by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way , that it is possible to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for the issuing of the goods in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the execution provisions , the competent authorities of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals inform the quantities that were issued for export lic@@ ences ; these data may , if necessary , de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to the country of origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee is concerned that the agreement will be properly applied and smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat market of both contracting parties and the market conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose specified in clause 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising in the implementation of the agreement which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement , irrespective of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties , shall apply within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount of annual volume set in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount paid by the entry into force of this year is set in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wording of this Protocol , which is equivalent to English , French and Russian , is equivalent to the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; container and in@@ fusion devices are provided with a label given in English and French , which corresponds to the pattern contained in the plants 2 to 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred can only be shipped in containers , where the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C throughout the transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ ro@@ y and non @-@ toxic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to add the consi@@ gn@@ ments required to the in@@ fusion equipment , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is a healthy person , and blood is missing with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) the diseases that are not free of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ded into a sterile bottle through a closed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution has been inj@@ ected before steri@@ lisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after termination of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is to be closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it may be opened immediately prior to using the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution should not be more than 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not drop 97 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood group , according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system , must first be determined by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by investigating the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood , which was replaced after the Convention , shall be used only for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is protected in sterile , closed bottle protected from micro@@ organisms and can be kept at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the time required for testing and transport , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood can be cooled back to 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the most part of the plasma has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or may have been removed partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product , but if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is to be indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all processes required for manufacturing must be performed under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , the volume and composition of the label must also be indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , which is deposited at the top by centri@@ fu@@ gi@@ zation or sedi@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry plasma is extracted by cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid from which one went out when producing the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations , in which ( using a fresh water sample ) have been found to be a dangerous content of I@@ son@@ hem@@ oly@@ sin or immune ha@@ em@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ins are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood flow , the steri@@ lity of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of the bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , the signs of bacterial contamination , are not used ; the steri@@ lity of every donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the risk of transmission of is@@ os@@ cul@@ ation@@ sh@@ uts , mixtures containing no more than 12 donations are to be used , or other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of the plasma , must be adjusted ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from it ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) Set a sufficient amount of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , 1 ml solution ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 ° . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de under a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm mercury may not occur in human dry plasma weight loss above 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry plasma is stored in a sterile , closed bottle under the exclusion of any micro @-@ organism and on the possibility of any moisture ; it must be protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human Alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C for 10 hours in the final container in order to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the ino@@ cul@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the weight of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin g per gram of the product may be present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pH value of each product must be dil@@ uted to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 ml of potassium chlori@@ de per litre at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss of 0.5 % may not occur in dry preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry alb@@ um@@ in is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an empty space in sterile , closed containers with exclusion of micro@@ organisms and on the possibility of moisture ; it must be protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions made up of human plasma proteins must be stored in sterile , sealed containers by excluding micro@@ organisms . they are protected from light and kept at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the label on the container contains all information registered on the corresponding sample ( plant 4 ) , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is a preparation made of plasma proteins , which was made from human , the antibodies of normal adult hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applied method of manufacture must ensure that the final product is tran@@ sm@@ uted the conditions described below , and does not transmit ino@@ cul@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the production method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantities in the final product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method is satisfactory for any final preparations in this regard , if in the starting and final product , antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ di@@ aled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance can be added ; to ensure the bacterial steri@@ lity and stability of the final product , it can be added to it a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ ser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final product is delivered as a solution , whose immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ konzentr@@ ation must be between 100 and 170 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) The electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , represented by free floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein contents have the flexibility of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of normal human plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final solution should not have any visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ ding after a 7 @-@ day heating . furthermore , it is advisable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test with the centri@@ fu@@ ge method in the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge , to determine in which mass the product is deca@@ ying with a lower molecular weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pH value of the final solution must be dil@@ uted to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 ml of potassium chlori@@ de per litre at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution from human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is to be stored in sterile , closed containers with exclusion of micro@@ organisms ; it must be protected from light and at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins can be produced ; if an international standard exists , they must be checked according to this standard and their efficiency is indicated in International units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human anti @-@ po@@ x immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin has at least 500 international units of small@@ po@@ x antibodies per ml , which are determined by a neutr@@ alisation test on ch@@ ori@@ o @-@ all@@ an@@ to@@ id membrane or tissue culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human anti @-@ tet@@ anus @-@ immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin has at least 50 international units containing tet@@ anus @-@ antibodies per ml , which are determined by a neutr@@ alisation test on the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rest , the specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins have the conditions provided in section 4 &quot; Nor@@ mal Human Immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the antibody level , the immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ in@@ konzentr@@ ation can fluctu@@ ate in the final solution between 100 and 170 g per litre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the label has to indicate the efficiency in international units according to the corresponding international standard or reference preparation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry fi@@ br@@ ella is a dry preparation from the soluble part of the fluid human plasma , which is transformed by adding th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in into fi@@ br@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applied method of manufacture must ensure that the final product comp@@ utes the conditions described below , and the danger of a transfer of the ino@@ cul@@ ation sh@@ uts is limited to a minimum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is placed in a solution of human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gens of the same concentration as fresh normal plasma , the cl@@ ot@@ ting must occur outside of the double time required for the cl@@ ot@@ ting of normal fresh plasma with th@@ rom@@ bin@@ additive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss above 0.5 % may not occur in the preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , the final product must prove to be sterile after testing a suitable bacter@@ i@@ ological method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an empty space in sterile , closed containers with exclusion of micro@@ organisms and on the possibility of moisture ; it must be protected from light and at the recommended temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I. The don@@ ors must be healthy and , in particular , free from communic@@ able diseases according to the criteria for human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cold precip@@ itation in the plastic bag , the product may not contain any existing organic solvents or other external substances in the freezer mixture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of tear@@ ing the plastic bag during storage in frozen condition can be reduced , so that each bag is stored in a protective box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood should be so centered , that its formed components will be removed as soon as possible after extraction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the addition of the given quantity of a suitable solvent must lead to the complete dissolution of the dry product in less than 30 minutes at 37 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in keeping with 20 C , the preparation may not have any precip@@ itation within three hours of dissolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered preparation is intended to contain the specified minimum quantity of vitamin VI@@ II , which corresponds to the effectiveness of 1 ml of normal fresh plasma ; the efficacy is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss of 1.5 % may not occur in the dry @-@ dried preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human factor VI@@ II is in deep frozen state at a temperature below - 30 C , and in freeze @-@ dried condition under 5 C and protect against light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tro@@ k@@ screw prepar@@ at is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed glass bottle using the exclusion of micro@@ organisms and on the possibility of moisture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the frozen state , the preparation may no longer be stored for longer than a year in the frozen state unless the required minimum effectiveness has been tested again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the label on the preparation contains all information registered on the corresponding sample , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the don@@ ors must be healthy and , in particular , free from communic@@ able diseases according to the criteria for human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final product tested using suitable methods must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and free of unwanted vas@@ o@@ depres@@ s@@ ant or respiratory effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the addition of the given quantity of the solvent must result in total dis@@ integration in 10 minutes at 37 C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rec@@ al@@ ci@@ fication time of a normal plasma may not be less than 40 seconds for measurement at 37 C , with the presence of an equal quantity of different solutions of the restored product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered product , which is added to the same quantity of fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gen ( 3 g / l ) , must not be gut@@ ted within six hours at 37 ° . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recovered preparation must include the specified minimum quantity to factor IX , whereby a unit of the effectiveness of 1 ml corresponds to normal fresh plasma ; the effectiveness is determined by a method approved by the competent national authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de under a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss over 1.5 % may not occur in the product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Parties of the European Convention on 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that &quot; the Parties shall meet all necessary measures &quot; to release the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this deliver@@ ance falls into the jurisdiction of the Community following the contract by which it was founded , which has the necessary powers to do so ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , it is necessary that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the Convention - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Convention enters into force on the first day of the month , following the signing of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes into effect on the first day of the month , following the day that the last of the parties have deposited their certificate of acceptance by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) This additional protocol , however , occurs after two years after the date in force to which it has been adopted , unless one of the contracting parties has notified a objection to its entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot be a contracting party of the convention without becoming a member of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe records the Member States of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the timing of the entry into force of this Ad@@ ditional Protocol according to Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General has also notified the European Economic Community every action , notification or communication related to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas it is most desirable , if Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are submitted together by the Member States , and the necessary facili@@ tation and exceptions are granted for their import . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the expression &quot; re@@ agents of blood group determination &quot; re@@ agents human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and determination of blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every party party may limit the use of this Convention on Re@@ agents of Human origin to the definition of blood group determination in the signing of this agreement , or the deposit of its rati@@ fication , appro@@ vals or accession documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by an Noti@@ fication , directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties agree to provide re@@ agents to determine the costs of their extraction , preparation , and transportation as well as the purchase price of other contracting parties , if they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are only provided by other parties , so that no profit is associated with that they are only used for medical purposes and only to be supplied by the governments involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every shipment of re@@ agents to the blood group determination shall be accompanied by a certificate , that they have been established in accordance with the rules of the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protocol and its installation constitute an administrative agreement , which can be altered or supplemented by the governments of the contracting parties of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties meet all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents made available to them from other contracting parties , in order to determine blood group determination from all input taxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances quickly reach the recipients , which are described in Article 3 , and in the shortest possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parties shall submit to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of positions which are authorised for the exhibition of the documents provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with articles designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention lays down for the members of the Council of Europe on the signing ; they can become the contracting party , by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention enters into force one month after the day , at which three members of the Council have signed it for Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval or have rati@@ fied or approved it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each member that this Convention is signed or rati@@ fied or approved without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after signing or closing the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following entry into force , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the members of the Council and the Advisory States a ) the timing of entry into this convention and the names of the members who have signed it without reservation or have rati@@ fied or approved it ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every party party may termin@@ ate this agreement , subject to a period of one year , by ad@@ mitt@@ ance to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples , containing the an@@ tigen containing the antibody or other substance indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended manner by the producer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the ti@@ ter is measured against double in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents , and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to definition , an international standard prepared contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture inside a series , in which a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard preparations are present ( Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the International standard preparation or a state standards preparation in International units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ans contain according to definition 256 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of a similar rating of the International standard ser Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain for at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility study , which is approved by the state supervisory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is sealed so that no moisture can enter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to result in specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml , flu@@ ent or re@@ dissolved serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents intended for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as an international agreement has come about a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient for conducting tests with the unknown blood cells but also for conducting tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantity in a container must be so large that , if necessary , the content can be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents , in order to determine blood group definition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appropriate samples of all re@@ agents that have been issued are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective means to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effective response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each individual container is a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. the quantity or , in the dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the quantity or , in the dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be accompanied by a certificate pursuant to Article 4 of the Convention , according to the system for this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected individuals of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub @-@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative par@@ ate separated against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it is glut@@ eal any human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity can belong to one of two types , which are distinguished by the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination is achieved hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; an ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef , or by other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; incomplete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are scre@@ ened in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h Group may be subject to change if International standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding comparative advantage over C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen C of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with flus@@ hing of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are only specific for the C an@@ tigen when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ ad blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is extracted from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen e of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera speci@@ f@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and speci@@ f@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons , or can be produced by mixing Anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all kinds of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ eal no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative preparation , separated with flus@@ hing A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it is glut@@ eal any human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative par@@ at , with a flus@@ hing of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B @-@ blood cells which is required if the same experiment with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of similar avi@@ dity is performed .
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s instructions , so ag@@ glut@@ eal is no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same or another di@@ lution , human red blood cells must also be ag@@ glut@@ inate , which are sensi@@ ti@@ sed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak comple@@ ments binding in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for clinical use , the load with all types of the above in@@ complete antibody should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human @-@ glob@@ ulin serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is extracted by extrac@@ ting from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant , and possibly subsequent cleaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ Anti@@ gens , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ eal no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in no case , the efficacy of the re@@ agent should not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent mixed with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 percent swelling of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells is required if the same experiment with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of similar avi@@ dity ( ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( vegetable )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is extracted by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant , and possibly subsequent cleaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that &quot; the Parties shall meet all necessary measures &quot; to release the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this deliver@@ ance falls into the jurisdiction of the Community following the contract by which it was founded , which has the necessary powers to do so ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of its entry into force , this supplementary protocol is part of the convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe records the Member States of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the timing of the entry into force of this Ad@@ ditional Protocol according to Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General has also notified the European Economic Community every action , notification or communication related to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 1 January 1988 , the Community decided to introduce uniform management paper for the strengthening of the single market within the Programme for Str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening the Single Market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in DER A@@ weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , particularly by the introduction of a single administration document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that this agreement should not be interpreted in detail , that the contracting parties are excluded from their obligations from other international agreements - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this convention , measures are stipul@@ ated in order to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , and in particular a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goods which are linked to the goods transport between the contracting parties shall be filled with a form of uni@@ formity , to be used in the App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper paper , depending on the case , serves as an application or paper for export , shipping method or import . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to carry out any legal provisions in force in a contractual party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single document ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to be demanded by the participants , so that they may come to an application in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , also using data processing , in view of further facili@@ tation for those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the concerned goods shall not be submitted to a customs office and the filing for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the filing of an incomplete application can be approved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these cases , a registration in which it can act with the approval of the relevant authorities for a periodi@@ c collective registration must be submitted within the deadline stated by the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use instead of a single api@@ ece trading paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the legal paper is used , the parties may join together with the consent of the relevant authorities to assist with the export and import duties in the trade usual lists in which the goods are described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to mutually exclude agreements or agreements with regard to a further simpli@@ fication of the activities for their entire goods traffic , or for sub @-@ areas ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments , which include several types of goods , in order to assist the conveying of the boxes in the des@@ patch procedure instead of the supplementary sheets to a form paper ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - allow applications to be issued by public or private data processing plants , if necessary , by the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the provisions listed in the App@@ endi@@ x I , are to be found in An@@ nex III on this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be carried out in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , approved by the competent authorities in the country in which the responsibility for ex@@ portation or dispatch shall be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or of its representatives in this country may request a translation of the registration in the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) De@@ vari@@ ance from paragraph 1 , the registration is always carried out in one of the official languages of the import country if they are registered in this country by the customs office of the export or retri@@ eval country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration copies required for each individual phase of the contract between the contracting parties , where appropriate copies may be included in one of the following sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective shipments , the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the requirements for exports and shipping procedures can be created by means of the copies provided for these form@@ ulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities agree as far as possible that the information contained in the individual proceedings of the application must match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the discovery of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they are interested in another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
