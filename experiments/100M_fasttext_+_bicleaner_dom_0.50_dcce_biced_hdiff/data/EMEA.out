this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. inten@@ tional thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder in which the patient have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal rush ) with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection solution is used to monitor increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for both diseases , the solution can be used for the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who take other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree , acts as neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 160 patients with A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo in another study compared to A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ jection Solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led to increased un@@ rest with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients addressed to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets , and the solution for det@@ aching ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reducing the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy , for up to 74 weeks , prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo , the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( hypertension ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , drow@@ sin@@ ess , tranqu@@ il@@ lity , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar episodes and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solutions in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . authorization to transport A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ id disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when handling with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant forms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a weight gain is commonly observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties in which weight gain is known as side effects and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central potent drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes can result in higher plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ c Met@@ aboli@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ deduc@@ tions should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be administered with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) and 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant , or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for human safety and due to the concerns arising in animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) in general and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic cases were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosage since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity with dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d and a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ bus .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a half @-@ surgery @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents participating in the trial were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia demonstrated for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a significantly higher reduction of the rel@@ ap@@ se rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks ago which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior compared to placebo in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance with or without psych@@ otic features which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission over 74 weeks before random@@ isation showed themselves to placebo considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mean elimination of el@@ min@@ ation is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metaboli@@ tes over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger for the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ based toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the concentrations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in G@@ alle by monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets can take the tablets alternatively to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a weight gain is commonly observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties in which weight gain is known as side effects or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles may lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they become pregnant or during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the medicine ( * ) :
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages leading to pre@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets can take the tablets alternatively to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .

the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .

it is suspected that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks ago which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study where the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers lay the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used to quickly control agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended with circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine on AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y melt tablets or AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l In@@ jection Solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant forms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight gain is commonly observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties in which weight gain is known as side effects or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles may lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the after single administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers were administered intra@@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes can result in higher plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ deduc@@ tions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was bigger compared to the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) in general and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic cases were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trial ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant increase in symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a half @-@ surgery @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents participating in the trial were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia demonstrated for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction of the return rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the starting value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C following the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 studies involving healthy volunteers , the average time for the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15 or 5 times above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular layers .
studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns following mat@@ ern@@ al exposure that lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the kan@@ o@@ genic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger for the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times of the mean cell state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane received treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were no difference between drugs , such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel in patients who had previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or at the beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ spinal cord in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP Commission concluded that in patients with the first treatment , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs to decrease side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2008 , the European Commission issued an authorisation for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ y &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and for all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation by pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel that could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the Neut@@ ro@@ p count rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a clearly marked Kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patients receive nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic agents and con@@ sti@@ tious remedies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , who do not exercise effective contrac@@ eption unless the mother &apos;s treatment with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women should have a reliable contrac@@ eption method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to witness , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are reported which occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , muscle pain , chest pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , chest pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the co @-@ operation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stabilization leads to a escap@@ ement of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies have been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ recipe and due to the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ ds protein SP@@ ARC ( whi@@ tish protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two solitary untreated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer in patients with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Results of the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 After an intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration took place in multi@@ phase mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or initiation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel with intraven@@ ous 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and also the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; p Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean value for the accumulation of ure@@ a was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are only a few data available about patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chemical and physical stability was proof@@ ed at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and light light protected over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as in other potentially toxic substances should be respected when handling Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full addition of the solution , the penetration bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the defle@@ c@@ tor should be turned slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously for at least 2 minutes , and / or inver@@ ted until complete res@@ us@@ ability of the powder is performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if precip@@ itation or sin@@ ks are visible , the penetration bottle has to be inver@@ ted gently to achieve complete res@@ us@@ ability before applying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , tell the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently used medications , as these might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women should have a reliable contrac@@ eption method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm conservation , because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment is the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should be filled immediately into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market , before the market launch , supplies medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Educational brochure • summary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the equivalent of a biological drug is similar , approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood iron levels , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur in case of blood trans@@ fusion , and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , having experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated for the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection can also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or for patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was placed , which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when administered as an injection into a vein in a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , the a@@ emia was compared to the an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study where the effects of inj@@ ected Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with patients suffering from an an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , bur@@ sting mi@@ gra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ y@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof , the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which makes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to obtain approval for the placing of off@@ stre@@ amed in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi @-@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; h@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; unless blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of planned major operating procedures ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for reduction of foreign blood , a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure in adults can be used without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except in pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low pH value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( h@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low pH value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( h@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te quantity to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value should the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg should be retained once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase is increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l should be maintained three times a week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ multiply by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood const@@ ants is required should be obtained in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body@@ weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron substitution should be started as early as possible , e.g. several weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should present 300 I.@@ U. / kg pre@@ oper@@ atively 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to ins@@ ure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ op@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia or PR@@ CA ) should not obtain a de@@ fl@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic disease : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti@@ endo@@ genic PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , a decrease in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( ov@@ ulation , fo@@ lic acid or inflamm@@ ations , hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be induced to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit @-@ risk assessment of the patient &apos;s participation and should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if possible before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure should have proper thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis because they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases especially in case of an underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa may be an increased risk for postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , blood levels should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chronic thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the genetically @-@ produced epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ emul@@ ating and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and did not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ ants ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
survival and progression of tumour were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and progression
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin demonstrated an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of obtaining a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans , and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 In veter@@ inary studies with approximately the 20@@ ples recommended for use at people recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced cervi@@ cal weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports are based on vitro findings with cells of human tumor tissue samples , but are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of the out@@ patient application , the patient can temporarily store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum period of 3 days outside of the fridge and not above 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with rank rings and the filling volume is indicated by a past@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial amounts is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors , which have experience in treating patients with the above indications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the license agreement has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 and approved in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is fully operational , before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the licensing agreement specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan stipul@@ ates that the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan , as well as in accordance with each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan approved by the CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for &quot; products for human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • for receiving new information , the influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures - according to the E@@ MEA request &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) - the risk of a coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) is - if you have previously performed such a blood cl@@ ut@@ rop@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms again during further treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the beginning of treatment with se@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin , er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin ) was very rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y , it will break your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death could be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with increased or increasing potassium levels , your physician may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically exposed coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion mark by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current findings , the treatment of hem@@ at@@ omas in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ los@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that se@@ amed amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may affect the tumor neg@@ atively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an orthop@@ edic surgery is about to happen , you should examine the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before treatment starts and be treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / applying other medicines or applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of developing the immune system e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify treatment success and make sure that the drug works properly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of gra@@ y@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify treatment success and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating physician will carry out regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time prior to surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out stre@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ en@@ ia means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when applying se@@ amed fl@@ amed &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after repeated blood donations , it may come - irrespective of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial tumor value is too high
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you are significantly impaired or if you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following illnesses : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) , both in women after menop@@ ause and in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ tur@@ istic risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ infection ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to treat the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized , or at least 75 % compared to its initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients with A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , or any other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ cla@@ sta manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drugs side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company to approve the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Con@@ tract indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When on medical or nursing assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg a@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operative care of hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently discovered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first a@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of a@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for these patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A can adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data for safety and efficacy are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid initiation of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of a@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be examined prior to using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of a@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta increased ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was comparable to 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) are listed in table 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid was associated with kidney function disorders that were associated with a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to the administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values found below the normal range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were found in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after frac@@ ture frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was generally treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients occurred in oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area , with A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of a@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified with either a frac@@ ture assessment ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the s@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a moderate @-@ severe existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the s@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aged 75 and older , A@@ cla@@ sta patients had reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures reduced by 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the skull by 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with a@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were collected one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ A ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the duration of studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall s@@ mortal was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at the total and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all time points compared to placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo and 4.3 % on the neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in untreated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , corresponding to the 2.6 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who were enrolled at the end of the six @-@ month study as Respon@@ der were included in the follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study the therapeutic response was observed in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at were maintained for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one time in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rapid bi@@ phas@@ eal disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total body @-@ clearing is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduced clear@@ ance of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Aci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ) and amounted to 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cre@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest un@@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the four@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) was administered well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that have exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formi@@ ties and those of the skeleton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human drugs , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known , the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities could affect the minim@@ ization of risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone patho@@ gen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is done too fast , and new bone material is structured as normal , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta acts by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or apply recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine that is known to the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient fluids before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have broken the hips recently , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than one year and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss A@@ cla@@ sta , you will be contacted immediately with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to ending the therapy with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical signs due to a low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps , or ting@@ ling or num@@ bing feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redness , diar@@ rhe@@ a , headache , headache , headache , headache , headache , headache , headache , headache , headache , skin rash , headache , skin rash , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( e.g. swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures recently , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative supply of hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid insertion of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia can develop whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of a@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and furthermore one or more I
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was used as a supporting remedy for setting smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A ? the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution is advisable while applying A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , p@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP Commission concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A in relation to weight reduction in patients with obesity , overweight or overweight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) and around the AR@@ Z

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in patients who - besides obesity - have no visible risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5.3 A@@ clinical data on safety of the following adverse events , which were not observed in clinical trials , which occurred in animals after exposure to the human @-@ therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress appears to be related to dealing with animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be set satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily in the highest tolerated dose alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ ylene and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied at 28@@ 9 patients the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with increased output Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the AL@@ T levels are up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are checked again as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops symptoms related to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , tor@@ ch@@ iness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker har@@ n , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is continued , should be led by clinical evaluation until the lab parameters have been presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , minor reduction of the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin can obtain the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , about an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not available from this data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to temporary changes in the lens and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T sti@@ ege on three times the upper limit of the normal range often appeared to be less common than placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch was rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , however , if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a summari@@ zing analysis of reports un@@ desirable from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ amine in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years in order to study the period up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine content was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small 18 weeks study of type 2 diab@@ etics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and a slight increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the total plasma matrix and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed while measured in Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ ced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ em@@ el@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) was induced by the bladder epitheli@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indications resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a further two @-@ year study , met@@ form@@ in combination therapy with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide was examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine Qu@@ oti@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but improved the post @-@ pran@@ ic elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level as well as an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the study was missing the objective of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mortal , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the dose of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of the packages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP Commission concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , in the treatment of diabetes , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , if a quick initial impact is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds , ensuring that the entire dose is inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the transition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after switching from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be used and taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy , and always ask his patients for drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 As hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dis@@ ruption of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Gel@@ som@@ ely - Peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disorders of the skin and skin tissue tissue joint - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise when failed to switch the injection points within the injection area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur during insulin therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases of the immune system Gel@@ som@@ ely - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diab@@ etics should always have glucose , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total dose is up to 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a series of split@@ ting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the operating instructions for the first use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after switching from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy , and always ask his patients for drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 As hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 13 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of absorption as a measure of the elimination per se of the plasma from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes in the blood@@ stream ) .

review a set dose • Record the number on the cap directly next to the dosage marker • Record the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have a wrong dose adjust the cap simply forwards or backwards until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise insulin will escape from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have accidentally tried to adjust a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , take the cap off and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) , or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the dose of acet@@ ab@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of quickly acting insulin must first be wound up , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the injection needle continues to move upwards , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( figure C ) • While the injection needle continues to move upwards , press the push button in the top ( figure C ) • Now a drop of insulin must leak from the tip of the injection needle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Connect the cap back to the finished pen , that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( figure D ) • Control whether the push button is fully pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic notes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still above 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months , more and more rheum@@ atism can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic can take other medicines at least during the first six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do drugs ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ isch@@ emia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements , less than 6 mg / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) showed an ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 13@@ 4 patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP Commission concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ ination ( including a disease known from the patient &apos;s history , and / or arthritis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , if the serum levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) , a dose increase of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety were not examined until now ( see Cre@@ ate Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other drugs , it may result in acute rheum@@ atism during the beginning of the treatment because the reduction of serum levels can initially be mobili@@ zed in tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) increase the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the fa@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ static treatment and further course of the liver ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not conduct interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O hibition can lead to an increase of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % and AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of a ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) is delayed and a decrease of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of gest@@ ational pregn@@ ancies do not include the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably secure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis , or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the patient &apos;s history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and the ( DU@@ T rating ) related to the medicine could be reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious skin r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 , or at lower frequency : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful non @-@ pur@@ ist inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro inhibit@@ ing that is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
placebo ( n = 13@@ 4 ) and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 13@@ 4 ) or al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 13@@ 4 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the start of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 0,5 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ atine levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.@@ 0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were consolidated for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and persi@@ sted throughout the entire treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) .
the results of the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ gan@@ ing no@@ des , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the top grades by month 24 in 54 % of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ dispro@@ portion@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cases of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 μ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum concentrations observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma bonding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms showed that these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are mainly produced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 and 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ed@@ F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) and its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabolism and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild or moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7,5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function at 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney end@@ ys@@ mal function .
12 Li@@ ver function Rest@@ ri@@ ction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes did not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metaboli@@ tes after taking multiple oral dos@@ ages of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and carcin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly doses treated group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ sation and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3- times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied with a decrease of the upward performance and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the offspring of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with expos@@ ures , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with expos@@ ures , which fertili@@ zed about 13 @-@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , showed no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious skin r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
26 as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) and A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) as well as known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes did not significantly change in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and carcin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly doses treated group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of authorization for placing the drug has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in Version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human drugs with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk management activities within 60 days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the crystal formation is prevented and thus with time a reduction of the discomfort is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this drug if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in the result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a failure in the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat sensation and joint swelling ) , wait until the pla@@ sty attack starts before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / applying other medicines or applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine or use one of the substances listed below . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the transport ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed so that you can check if you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken over@@ dose , contact your doctor or the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C intake , take it as soon as possible unless the next intake is imminent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you break AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ aci@@ acid concentration may rise again , and your discomfort can wor@@ sen because new elem@@ ental crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frequent side effects ( more than 1 of 100 treatments but less than 1 out of 10 treatment ) : • Sever@@ al liver tests • diar@@ rhe@@ a • headache • skin rash • nausea

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid an irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company prescri@@ bes data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who solely received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also stipul@@ ates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is required for preventing bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( swal@@ lowing ) , ab@@ domin@@ als ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as acid b@@ ump@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following guidelines are to be observed carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty should be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible bre@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia or pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of serious bre@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which refer to a G@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are transmitted to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , including some serious and complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no data available to give evidence , whether the rejection of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients undergoing ortho@@ don@@ tic surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient , based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE they should take the pill the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the day of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the onset of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in healthy subjects the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily into soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it influences the elimination of other drugs by these transport systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tablets are available as rectangular , white or broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 270 &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent is administered to adult patients , who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent gra@@ ft rejection by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , and the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a duration of a year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , more than 120 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were conducted and investigated , such as Adv@@ agra@@ f , compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients and physicians must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hard capsules with ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules . printed in red ink on the bright yellow cap top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sel bottom with &quot; D@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the close supervision of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Advent should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to the level of tal@@ low in both kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation in Adv@@ agra@@ f in order to ensure adequate substance exposition in the immediate night transport phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the an@@ agra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral advent therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as daily daily gift in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabilization after transplantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral advent therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as daily daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ould a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipient of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f should be converted to one once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant has to commen@@ ce for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients did not have clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pulmon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ reas@@ - and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in color@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood tal@@ ents in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with reduced kidney function , since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in- to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases , using full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ mirrors controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seb@@ ac@@ eous levels during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood seb@@ ac@@ eous levels should also be checked after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the seb@@ ac@@ eous levels exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical practice , serum levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually associated with liver transplan@@ ts in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in patients with heart transplan@@ ts at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the close supervision of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , no clinical data is available for the s@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f in order to prevent tran@@ spl@@ ant gra@@ ft rejection in adult cardiac tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the seizure of herbal medicinal products ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described under Pro@@ gra@@ f was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hard@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose deficiency , lac@@ tose @-@ lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , and lac@@ tose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinct interaction has been made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole and flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ pan antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the hibition of gastro@@ intestinal contamination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can compromise their metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the balance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions about contrac@@ eption measures are taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of examinations in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not provide an indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be identified precisely because of the patient &apos;s health , and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often elevated in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( vir@@ als , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal corneal cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by their binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucleus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ inum @-@ dependent hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g@@ amma @-@ interfer@@ on ) and expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
the patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advent arm 25 ( 14 women and 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women and 19 men ) died .
kidney transplantation The effectiveness and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ; in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advent arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ ph was compared with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incidence of therapeutic failure after 12 months ( defined as death and tran@@ spl@@ ant loss ; biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) .
the difference in the treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( -@@ 9.@@ 9 % = 5.0 % ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 5.0 % reduction interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % ; 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of two pro@@ gra@@ f capsules based on two primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant according to pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 175 patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had undergone pancre@@ atic transplantation , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f reports over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first year after the tran@@ spl@@ ant , chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection was observed less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in cases treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . ) An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rite level and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the untreated group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of the metabolism led by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seb@@ ac@@ eous levels during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , no clinical data is available for the s@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent is used to treat and prevent hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital thro@@ mbo@@ sis caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether to be used for the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , or for the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was placed , which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ates is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ates in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ is@@ o@@ ds with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ates may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , to the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the danger is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose rate should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest in the first 20 expos@@ ures and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exc@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development the re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product was observed in another way to re@@ occur ( low @-@ tide ) inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AD@@ R@@ s ( 5 patients ) which had previously untreated patients had head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ ative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously untreated patients from a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but no signs or symptoms were encountered which showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the product is still stored in the refrigerator , remove both bur@@ sting bottles with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E powder and solvents from the refrigerator and heat up at room temperature ( between 15 and 25 ° C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significant increase in the pulse rate can usually be lowered immediately by means of slow or temporary interruption of the injection ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 , 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to be evaluated positively , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile that necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited was officially approved by the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw his application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body are affected ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a kind of virus , which has been genetically altered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the review of initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP issued a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever and inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ates as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms , which were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nas@@ al nas@@ al symptoms , patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ory hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for treating allergies ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data , for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms do not end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use for 10 days , as long @-@ term application reduces the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of ending such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ha@@ ka@@ olin etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed that treatment in hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ mi@@ rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the headache ) must be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; care should be taken care of : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder hal@@ ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be suspended at least 48 hours before performing mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ determin@@ acy of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies yiel@@ ded no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases there may be a presum@@ ption that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , anxiety , frigh@@ tened mic@@ tion , muscular weakness , respiratory failure , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , ag@@ at@@ ia , blur@@ red vision or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pu@@ pi@@ l rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 and IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is trace@@ able within 30 minutes of the treatment in plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the floating equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects were ill @-@ metaboli@@ sed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the regulatory application described , Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance System is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane which is s@@ wollen , containing pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ga@@ ul@@ cer ) , a closure of the stomach or du@@ oden@@ um ( intestinal closure ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ men in the patient &apos;s history ( breathing difficulties due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases appear or diagnosed with you following the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze • Cardi@@ ac disease • nausea and headache , or reinfor@@ cing existing head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transport ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines In the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze results in di@@ zz@@ iness or reduced attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and use the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or rash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , di@@ zz@@ iness , fatigue with increased physical activity , in cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values was also very seldom reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impairment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the SP Europe company for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day with one or without a meal to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease progression , and may be resum@@ ed after the onset of symptoms and resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for prolonged treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases there may be a presum@@ ption that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 the most common side @-@ effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 and IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhesion of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measured parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of eyes , and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , it is expected that , in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , there is an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an improvement of the Ju@@ ck@@ irrit@@ ations by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation , after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) had no effect on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available which support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with a@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is impaired to metaboli@@ se , is identical to that of children who normally metaboli@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance should not use glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not affect psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increasing the alcohol @-@ induced impairment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are impaired metaboli@@ se .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation , after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 . in several single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ lass bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with a application spra@@ yer for preparations for setting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take once a day in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate can be taken for taking without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) was used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measuring parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the G@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us melted tablet proved bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the taking @-@ up formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the spread of this poorly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and under black ( adults 18 % ) and the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irritation tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is impaired to metaboli@@ se , is identical to that of children who normally metaboli@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group , similar to the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for det@@ ecting no side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be observed in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because A@@ eri@@ us has the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is inter@@ mitt@@ ent ( the symptoms will occur less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) , your doctor will recommend you a treatment scheme that depends on your illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is persistent ( the symptoms may occur in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , your doctor may recommend you a longer lasting treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for the authorisation of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks off when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the immune system is able to train fast antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this common ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that identifies the human body as a foreign body ) is puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines used to treat adults and children over four years using the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for det@@ ecting , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is based on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and maintains it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aids cannot cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infection @-@ related infections and illnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 20@@ 6 adults , which used to take prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , this medicine was compared with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the medicines used in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r extracts the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , there was a greater drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous Prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 / 3 may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ oplas@@ tic , or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who are infected with cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are broken down in the blood and are harmful to health in high concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the use of am@@ o@@ ases in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was not detected in patients who had not taken Prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the placing of am@@ o@@ ases throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , nas@@ ol@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters should be administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of ammon@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore nas@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for nas@@ ol@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of ammon@@ ica twice a day , together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If the nas@@ ol@@ ase capsules are used without the reinfor@@ cing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of am@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of ammon@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg ammon@@ ion that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ac@@ re@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ammon@@ ites during the ing@@ es@@ tion of ammon@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ o@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , nas@@ ol@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the specialist information for this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 a simultaneous administration of am@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who use these drugs at the same time , am@@ amm@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other conditions associated with the treatment of medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. a higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology was adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol use , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width can not be combined with medicines , whose agents are metaboli@@ zed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of ammon@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in trying to compensate the obtained plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were frequently observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of ammon@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has already enrolled Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ on@@ o@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , to check the virus load and add the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with ammon@@ ion ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ oplas@@ tic were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
52 % humili@@ ated if ammon@@ ite ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if ammon@@ ium avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ion and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ ine component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with ammon@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effect of N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in could possibly sun@@ k the serum concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ a@@ vir@@ is could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly more subtle plasma level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of ammon@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of ammon@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with r@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ o@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of fossil @-@ avi@@ r and 100 mg chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ Cluster ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ car@@ dam@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interaction with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it is recommended that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may cause resor@@ ption problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) can lead to degradation of the ammon@@ ion plasma level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous consumption with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) the fluor@@ es@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous application of ac@@ re@@ ase with k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administration of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because plasma increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while the administration of ammon@@ ion can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is advisable while applying A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with ammon@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for respiratory symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given at the moment , such as adapting the ammon@@ ium vir@@ - dose if ammon@@ ion is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous administration of Var@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , ammon@@ ium @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if ammon@@ ites are transferred into breast milk in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are drugs applied to the HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors received 1,@@ 200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients and during the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , previously untreated patients with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 performed in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with ammon@@ ites had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors ; advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of am@@ gener@@ ase twice a day along with low @-@ dose k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable to the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K levels ( Grade 3 and 4 ) that were observed in patients who received an@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and ga@@ g pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene steps with the result of a formation of im@@ mature and non infectious viral particles .
anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ oplas@@ tic lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the connection between the activity of ammon@@ ion against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossil @-@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of fossi@@ ls with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study occurred a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to 48 hours with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically tested .
gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 5@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 5@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 5 ( 700 mg of fossil @-@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure performed in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks ago to follow the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ car@@ dam@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V or I@@ 5@@ 4@@ A / L / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic data based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to anth@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between ammon@@ ium and other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossil @-@ avi@@ r resistance path@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment path@@ ways ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) which resulted in a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) and sac@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and animal pran@@ ay@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) and animal pran@@ ay@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , ammon@@ ium reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ; a random@@ ized open study in which PI pre @-@ treated ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI mainly used with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ stop threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was diagnosed twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) , or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , consideration should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ blocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of ammon@@ ium with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of ammon@@ ica 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ ni@@ vor@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ related ammon@@ ion that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration of abnormal ammon@@ ion remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall concentrations in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of am@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ite exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules , therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of ammon@@ ium and chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these treatment schemes lead to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1,@@ 200 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ oplas@@ tic mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occur in dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of the human being after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated , and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mice and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r was neither presum@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 When A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the reinfor@@ cing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of am@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of ammon@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg ammon@@ ion that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of ammon@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if ammon@@ ium avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ion and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with ammon@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of ammon@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) the fluor@@ es@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
simultaneous administration of Var@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of ammon@@ ion is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , ammon@@ ium reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be considered in therapy optimisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration of abnormal ammon@@ ion remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall concentrations in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of ammon@@ ium and chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages which de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of the human exposure after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ o @-@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mice and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ oplas@@ tic was neither presum@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results suggest that in young animals the metaboli@@ sation routes are not fully mature , so that Am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r or other critical constitu@@ ents of the wording ( z ) are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aph@@ rodi@@ si@@ ac &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was not used in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore nas@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for am@@ o@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ sting avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of ammon@@ ion that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , because there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though a dose adjustment for ammon@@ ion is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ in , it is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous administration may lead to a fierce in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines , and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as heart rhythm disorders ( z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should be advised that am@@ o@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of dying from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drugs - 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of ammon@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous consumption with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the potential risk for humans is not known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l may not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , ammon@@ ium @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if ammon@@ ites are transferred into breast milk in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are drugs applied to the HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossil @-@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , consideration should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ blocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ousin volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated , and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - If any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of kni@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in order to increase the effect of an@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor , and your treatment history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the above drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sters ) , make sure that before starting treatment you have read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , there is no adequate provision to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for the ampli@@ fication of children aged 4 to 12 years or in general for patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gen@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ regeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can take certain medicines that can cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ doc@@ ain , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that HIV positive women should breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances , in order to avoid the transmission of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines There were no studies on the influence of aura on the driving ability , or the ability to operate machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after consultation with your doctor , please consult your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ) is taken , it is advisable that you are taking this more than one hour before or after ac@@ re@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ac@@ re@@ ase can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1,@@ 200 mg ammon@@ ica twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 85 Dam@@ it A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a larger amount of an@@ gener@@ ase than you should have taken , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking the intake as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when treating HIV infection , it is not always possible to say whether any side effects are caused by an@@ gener@@ ase , by other medicines that are taken simultaneously or caused by the HIV infection itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , feeling of fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness sensation , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious in nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depression , depression , sleep disorders , loss of appetite ting@@ ling in the lips and in the mouth , un@@ controll@@ able movements pain , discomfort or over@@ acid stomach , soft chairs , increase of certain liver enzymes called &quot; am@@ yl@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elevated blood glucose levels for sugar or cholesterol ( a certain blood fat ) Incre@@ ased blood values of a substance called B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin swelling of the face , lips and tongue ( angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast enlargement and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ ern@@ acken &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gen@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ regeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply of the bone ) may develop bone disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ) is taken , it is advisable that you are taking this more than one hour before or after ac@@ re@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ac@@ re@@ ase can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 94 So that A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking it as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , feeling of fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness sensation , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious in nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken larger amounts of as@@ gener@@ ase than you should , if you have taken more than prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nas@@ ol@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nas@@ ol@@ ase solution for intake was not covered with patients pre @-@ treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the application of low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to strengthen the effect &#91; boo@@ padding &#93; of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake can be given no dosage recommendations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution to take , or additionally take prop@@ yl eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l while taking A@@ gener@@ ase solution ( see also A@@ generative may not be taken ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may observe you possibly on side effects associated with the prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into consideration , especially if you have a kidney or liver illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 111 If you are certain medicines that can cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ doc@@ ain , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( solution to take ) or add additional prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l , while taking A@@ gener@@ ase ( see A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important information on certain other components of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake The solution for intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can cause side effects in high doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propylene gly@@ co@@ l may cause a number of side effects including var@@ ic@@ ose , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of the red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , special precau@@ tions are needed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking the intake as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , feeling of fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness sensation , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious in nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast enlargement and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ ern@@ acken &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , meth@@ y@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , acet@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l 400 , sac@@ char@@ ine sodium , natural pe@@ pper@@ mint aroma , le@@ mon@@ en@@ tho@@ l , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate d@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas it is up to 16 weeks to apply five times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas it is repeated five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a , in addition , was tested in two studies involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The total heal rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas demonstrated a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time apply and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ dicals area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , moist@@ ened skin area until the cream is completely covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , an examination should take place between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection , or gra@@ ft vs. host@@ - reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a leading stri@@ k@@ score were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation caused by treatment and / or temporary physical impairment was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and perio@@ dicals , no clinical experience has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data indicate an increased rate of cow@@ ard@@ t reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the removal of the gra@@ dients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical result of the therapy can be evaluated about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as no data is available for long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there is no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very limited data are available on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulation properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects go to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , fet@@ ching or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we have not been able to quanti@@ fy quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation is given to the application during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most commonly shared and possibly possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cra@@ mp@@ ers ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort at the application site , with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Creme from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
this review of clinical signs indicated that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème often resulted in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) and erosion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the test plan , the clinical evidence indicated that these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in serious er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ ink@@ age and dis@@ armament ( 19 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accidental or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the patients were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a complete healing was achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients versus 5 % of 161 in placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five weeks of application for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hist@@ ologically , the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions in a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approved indications of external cow@@ or@@ kers , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed at three times weekly , during 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ ho@@ ur@@ ly half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ month study , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice , during mal@@ er administration on three days a week , did not indu@@ ce tumours at the site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is considered very low due to systemic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice , treated with the substance @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with inferior U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - If any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals and anus ( after ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if left untreated , it may result in hi@@ ring , especially in the face - therefore early recognition and treatment is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma or the acute cy@@ al cell carcin@@ oma or the virus responsible for the infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or any other similar preparations before you begin with the treatment , consult your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not in@@ war@@ dly apply the cream as your doctor . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which will give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are broken , you can continue the treatment . o In@@ form your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleaning under the fores@@ kin is not carried out , swelling and th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties can be rec@@ eded while with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after intercourse ( not before ) perform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , because it is not known if I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od passes into breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of cra@@ mp@@ war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the cow@@ ards and rub gently on the skin until the cream is completely covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What must you consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks each week , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent side effects ( in case of less than 1 out of 10 patients ) can expect occasional side effects ( in less than 1 of 100 patients ) Very rare side effects ( in case of less than 1 out of 10,000 patients ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor / pharmac@@ ist or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections ; it can cause you to get a blue stain faster , or you can cause fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you may experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually these are lighter skin reactions , which disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the location of the application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , tum@@ bling , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ redness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , skin irritation , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and accumulate in most of the organs in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor , which possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , the safety of the medicine was mainly studied , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effectiveness in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is used to observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approval for the placing of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor , who possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , increases every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is little experience in re@@ starting the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after an interruption of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ ren@@ ka ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions involving 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory passages and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Un@@ desired drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg IV once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most patients showed a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after onset of treatment with a more severe form of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version usually within one month ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no det@@ ectable antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with no Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with inf@@ low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate , and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and recorded by cells in the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the FE@@ V expected to be expected , and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be shown in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over this period , the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung volume increases further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirrors in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental develop@@ mental speed after the Z @-@ score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean postoperative form showed a normal mental develop@@ mental speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg IV once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar , as was the case with older and less strongly affected patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which sp@@ li@@ ts certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , is completely absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have a serious allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tips for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient we@@ ars this , will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the past , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Ref@@ lec@@ ted • Ref@@ ill oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action to the in@@ fusion site &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , evaluated annually , and if necessary , the packaging supplement will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was controlled under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient first the number of di@@ lution bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should have a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicine against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer time of operation in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) were compared with the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were given an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months when performing C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in both studies patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times when administered by A@@ lim@@ ta compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each penetration bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding volume of required dosage is taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100@@ ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for large plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a Kor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) and as@@ part@@ at @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new course of treatment , a dose examination will take place under the circumstances of the di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are suitable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( Exc@@ ept neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped when in patients after 2 can @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 or so - on the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 or more , compared to patients at the age of 65 , there is an increased risk of side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data , for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ inal value of &gt; &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be monitored and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ logy number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ , and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ ic number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be treated with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be induced prior to the pre@@ mixed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this ingredient was usually given in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible effect of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment procedure to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , caution is advisable when treating high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
because there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy unless absolutely required , and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the semen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reported cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by refra@@ ining important metabolic @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS : a multi@@ center random@@ ised single @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed a clin@@ ically meaningful visual survival compared to patients who were only covered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients , who received the examination medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ ne@@ e ) related to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the use of the L@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the common C@@ is@@ p@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control room .
a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy used a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 17@@ 2 ; 6.@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months ; adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 ; p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival revealed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = inten@@ to @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally for non @-@ superi@@ ority ; with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ level limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were studied at 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours of application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma amounts to 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs who had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months , they were observed ( de@@ genetic ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not applied , the retention times and conditions after the preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dissolve the content of the 100 mg cup bottles with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preservatives . this results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the product quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each glass bottle has to be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

dissolve the contents of the 500 mg / ml cup bottles with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preservatives which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , reduced fat diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ ec@@ es , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , drau@@ ght ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may not be used in patients with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric acid @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and young people under the age of 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only absorbed minim@@ ally , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of getting gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if it is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dose of the anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea , it is recommended to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a decrease of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most patients undergoing clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it should be recommended to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the gift of a single dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who were at the same time or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( incidence on the basis of data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of known side effects noted after the roll@@ out of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events voluntarily were reported by a population of in@@ definite magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; † It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety in terms of potential and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the anti@@ pa@@ ase properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the therapeutic effect decreases in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , blocking the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two double @-@ blind random@@ ised and placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60@@ mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric acid @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the total pri@@ est@@ rate was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist size was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ em@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients receiving the minimal systemic absorption , two main metaboli@@ tes , namely , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ to@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , identified approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , hurri@@ can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults over 18 years with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height , or are overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a control examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 2 kg of body weight , which you lose weight as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before taking all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take any medicine and if you take drugs for high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to define your calorie and fat boundaries , see more helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a meal or a meal contains no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get used to your body in the new eating habits , start the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutrition cook@@ books are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reach your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • To reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) , T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember to ask your doctor beforehand , if you are not used to physical activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • all@@ i must@@ n &apos;t be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of application , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in certain circumstances , you need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about switching the diet short @-@ term and then returning to old habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule intake . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment start , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in several days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is sin@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , learn to control them with time by adapting their diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently healthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which quantity is suitable for you , take out the information below that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ oric intake should allow you to gradually lose weight by about 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and also observe them . • Sen@@ se to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ ori@@ - and gre@@ asy du@@ ets and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a tailored weight loss program , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are excessive nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 19@@ 1 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ is is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon as@@ sage , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or sign of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable in simultaneous application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval extends or who tend to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not used to treat or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five examined chemotherapy drugs ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds . a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ine , chor@@ us avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need to experience pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron application in human gest@@ ational pregn@@ ancies , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the most frequent side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be associated with Alo@@ is ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies were found of adverse events like in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aly@@ sis studies were not carried out , but a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 intraven@@ ously were given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following tables , the results of the studies with immun@@ o@@ eto@@ id chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the objective of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption After an intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dose range from 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
after intraven@@ ous application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean mean ( ± SD ) was measured from day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations suggest that the total body composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable with the value measured after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however the C@@ MA@@ x was above the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ vitro studies of metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine . pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the overall body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29@@ ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but reducing the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicates that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma , pancre@@ as , epi@@ der@@ mis and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this approval for the placing of information must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the medicine approved within this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver illness , caused by viral infection ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the Li@@ ver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) have been elevated in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was inj@@ ected , which stimulates the formation of the active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data proving the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , we measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was adjusted to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the active ingredient and the marketing agent to be marketed will not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug develops an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately validated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is accompanied by cra@@ sten@@ ing ) and small infected layers ( crack or cut @-@ off ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or believed to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ ma may not work against this type of infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo discussed treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home customers , around 90 % of both groups were treated for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the place of the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small det@@ oxi@@ fication , abra@@ sions or wound wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and consider an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be interrupted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection commen@@ ced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected position occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effects of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area have not been studied , and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations found in humans after a topical application on sk@@ it@@ ened skin or infected surface wounds ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be rose by 81 % for healthy adult men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical treatment in patients , dose adjustments are not required when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement regarding effect on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to consider the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irritation involving the administration of about 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode Eff@@ ect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin ; a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin be question@@ able on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance , a consultation should be targeted by experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of failure on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients , before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of pe@@ ened skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymp@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats @-@ micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a Gaz@@ ever@@ cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium p@@ ou@@ ch containing 0,5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereas a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immune operation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine that has been approved since 1996 , and has been the approved vaccine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given an existing vacc@@ ination plan within three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the application of ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration one month after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month interval between the two injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six , and a 12 @-@ month gap between the injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection spot , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of ambi@@ rix in the whole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , and the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a collection formulation is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immune @-@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected from immune memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As for all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from immune system disorders , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses may be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these injection routes should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separated injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , ac@@ ell@@ ular poly@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix compatibility was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a basis of calculation per vaccine ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ valence was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received the placebo received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and pain was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , was not reported per pro@@ band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 according to the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune responses that were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that observed after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the collection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- and ac@@ ell@@ ular poly@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conver@@ sions , as for the earlier formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both before and after the Res@@ us@@ pen@@ ding , the vaccine is examined to investigate possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ owned batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a steady treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected before the dose of both vacc@@ ination doses Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection against other infections , which may harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , an allergic reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. , within six months and before the scheduled dosage of the second vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine , with a reduced content of effective components , is usually given one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vaccine series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response is to vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child can take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has been given or has been planned in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate parts and as many as possible extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered , unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the inc@@ ision or redness • mat@@ ur@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite , loss of appetite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Deter@@ min@@ ations • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other side effects , which have been reported for days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 blocked doses ) are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include loc@@ ally limited or extended r@@ ashes which can be it@@ ching or ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain var@@ ic@@ ose , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ run &quot; , multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels discomfort or illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rhe@@ a , and stomach pains , abnormal bleeding or bru@@ ising ( blue spots ) , caused by waste of the blood plat@@ el@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
23 Do not inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child greatly affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this packing supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the data that has become known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , because ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is administered - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ ze could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , headache , headache , nausea , diar@@ rhe@@ a , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , Am@@ mon@@ aps was effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ze was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage already mani@@ f@@ ests itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for babies , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ ar phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the emergence of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events had assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis ( severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia ) and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate associated with intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate obtained from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced for each gram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life to death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ ric oxide ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet were 98 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies can hardly be reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by taking a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycl@@ ine disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma can be detected .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours , approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the approved product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no bad effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either or@@ ally taken ( babies and children who can &apos;t swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants and infants with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ ar phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before birth , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ tes of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) were exposed to les@@ ions in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis ( severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia ) and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess fat .
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the duration of shelf life , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after consuming proteins in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , impairment of hearing impaired , memory disorders , and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or contact your hospital for an introduction to appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , headache , headache , headache , fatigue , kidney function , weight gain , and anom@@ al@@ ous lab results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the exp@@ iry date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is no longer permitted to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on the same individual doses or@@ ally or via a Magen@@ to ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 31 • Take a straight edge from the tank . • Take a straight edge , for example a knife back over the top of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , e.g. with unstable ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow , and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 14@@ 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during PCI , patients often underwent a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as c@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S was angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI administration - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as well as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was much more effective than pi@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for placing angi@@ ox in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary ar@@ thro@@ sis ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ho@@ ist@@ ing inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , an emergency intervention or an early intervention is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a stu@@ ds of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is re @-@ examined 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din bol@@ us without dose adjustment with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Vol@@ un@@ tary hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges of arter@@ ial points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally occur everywhere during the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ or ) , these active substances can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal experiments are insufficient with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , fet@@ ching or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional or ano@@ x apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding performed under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din significantly less frequently than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ n plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ date in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , both light and heavy bleeding decreased significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes listed in table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately stopped and the patient is closely mes@@ hed to monitor signs of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds th@@ rom@@ mb@@ ine both at the cataly@@ tic centre and to the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ ine an@@ thro@@ mb@@ ine region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly split up the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , serum @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was indu@@ bit@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is documented by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , high @-@ risk patients with angi@@ ography were distributed evenly across the 3 treatment arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; * Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l before angi@@ ography or before PCI 1 A AC@@ U@@ ITY bleeding was defined as one of the following events : hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pe@@ p@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is expected to go through a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary metaboli@@ te resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 bond of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by thro@@ mb@@ ine is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elimination occurs in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a process of first order , with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was restricted to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects as a result of longer @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ opathic co@@ ag@@ ulation were observed after short @-@ term exposure , even with a much higher dosage , not observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution is not carried out under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is not stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose 1 @-@ 1 @-@ glass cup bottles , sealed with but@@ yl rubber stop@@ pers and sealed with pressed aluminum cap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a penetration bottle of angi@@ ox , and slightly wa@@ ved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 ml are taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) for injection in a total volume of 50 ml in order to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood , or insulin cannot be processed effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was observed in insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or for patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH authorization for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the upper leg or the del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ ted by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the reduced glucose ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of the effective strength , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc lag etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision , and may require a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change when the treatment plan is changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics belong to the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of symp@@ athy such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ embry@@ onic and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin sur@@ passes human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter the mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ bed after oral use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , and can subsequently occur a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be given by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or administered by a physician by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a glu@@ co@@ agon@@ izing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as by blocking glucose production in the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the time of operation is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0.@@ 05 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg and an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ean effect just like human insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin , and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data it was evident that at an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ ized normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , like in human normal insulin , is given before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) given before the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ ized normal insulin that was given 30 minutes ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ine that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
