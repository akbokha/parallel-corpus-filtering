this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. cervi@@ cal thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients may have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection solution is used to monitor increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for both diseases , the solution can be used for taking or applying the tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who use other medicines same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree , acts as neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which led to increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol versus A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy In@@ jection Solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led to increased un@@ rest with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients addressed to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets , and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials with the injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly greater dis@@ ruption in the symptoms than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy , for up to 74 weeks , prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( swelling ) , headache , blur@@ red vision ( sleep@@ iness ) and drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ va production ) ; fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ; tranqu@@ il@@ lity ; in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant forms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 late dy@@ sp@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) may result in common application with effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the joint gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) and 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor , if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for human safety and for the concerns arising in animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against operating dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , D@@ yst@@ colony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) - generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic - were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , chronic cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosage since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is presum@@ ed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity with dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity with dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d and a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a half @-@ surgery controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents participating in the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions Rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia demonstrated for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study at schiz@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks ago which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder presented Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a versus placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior versus placebo in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , mainly in preventing a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ c Met@@ aboli@@ c Met@@ aboli@@ c Met@@ aboli@@ c Met@@ aboli@@ c Rate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar to patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ loss @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of y@@ op@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
the concentrations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets may alternatively take tablets to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy . also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant , or during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the medicine ( * ) :
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder presented Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a versus placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages leading to pre@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets may alternatively take tablets to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is presum@@ ed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study at schiz@@ ophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks ago which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus placebo no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution for taking with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects lay the relationship between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ theless a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of y@@ op@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used to quickly control agi@@ lity and behavior in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended with circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine on AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y melt tablets or AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no investigations about the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l In@@ jection Solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant forms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored with regard to worsen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers were administered intra@@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ c regul@@ ators can result in higher plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were administered intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
107 The following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) - generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic - were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trial ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant increase in symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a half @-@ surgery controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients enrolled in the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates , showed significantly greater improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia demonstrated for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase , mainly in preventing a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 studies involving healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l induction solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15 or 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure that lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional research with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the kan@@ o@@ genic potential , pre @-@ clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ loss @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean cell @-@ state exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean cell state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of whom had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine about three quarters earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole application or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane received treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were not seen in terms of efficacy indicators , such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , patients who previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding , or at the beginning of treatment , have low neut@@ ro@@ spinal cords in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Medic@@ ines Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) states that , in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs , it was not more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to decrease side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2008 , the European Commission issued an authorisation for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ ology &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Level 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on level 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abrasion is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to not sufficient data for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel that could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients , no new abrasion treatment cycles should be resum@@ ed until the neut@@ rons rise again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a clearly marked Kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patients receive nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic agents and con@@ sti@@ tious remedies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , who do not exercise effective eption contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , while and up to six months after the treatment no child will be able to testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the transport ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are reported which occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased glucose in the blood , increased glucose in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an optimization mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the interaction of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stabilization leads to a escap@@ ement of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies have been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ ds protein SP@@ ARC ( secondary protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two ar@@ gues untreated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ as@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Results of the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease , and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for abrasion on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the exposure to active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration took place in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or consec@@ ration of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel with intraven@@ ous 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the clearance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and also the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it reports that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α @-@ hy@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of the unchanged active ingredient was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are only a few data available about patients at the age of over 75 , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and above light light for over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and similar to other potentially toxic substances should be treated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane penetration bottle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full addition of the solution , the penetration bottle should be at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the defle@@ c@@ tor should be slowly and gently turned and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until complete res@@ us@@ ability of the powder is performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if cavi@@ ties or sin@@ ks are visible , the penetration bottle must be gently inver@@ ted in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ board before applying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspen@@ sions necessary for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing of goods before the market launch of medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies provided with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Educational brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( expert information ) , labelling and packaging supplement . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ators are provided for transport by patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood pressure levels in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , and blood loss can be expected from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with gra@@ y@@ amed treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases indicated for the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ y@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection can also be made by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was placed , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when administered as an injection into a vein in a study with 4@@ 79 patients , the an@@ a@@ emia was compared to the an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study where the effects of inj@@ ected in the skin were analysed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with patients suffering from a ren@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , bur@@ sting mi@@ gra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ amed should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ y@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , it has been proven that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to obtain approval for the placing of stre@@ amed in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; ( no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of planned major operating procedures ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for reduction of foreign blood , a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery can be used without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease status is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low pH value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low pH value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te quantity to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the starting value should the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in @-@ rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the starting value the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value by ≥ 0.1 ml / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l the dose should be kept at 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te size by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood const@@ ants is required should be obtained in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body@@ weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron substitution should be started as early as possible , e.g. several weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should present 300 I.@@ U. / kg pre@@ oper@@ atively 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to ins@@ ure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ op@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not get amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic disease : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti@@ endo@@ genous PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden loss of time , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ litre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te figures are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be induced to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the sei@@ zur@@ es and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evidence coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the combination of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit @-@ risk assessment of the patient &apos;s participation and should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if possible before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure should have adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , blood levels should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ lic events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the genetic @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ zed and identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate part is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and did not affect leu@@ kop@@ la@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ ants ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mal carcin@@ oma , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin demonstrated an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of obtaining a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans , and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 In veter@@ inary studies with approximately the 20@@ ples recommended for use at humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced levels of body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports are based on vitro findings with cells of human tumor tissue samples , which are of in@@ secure significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of out@@ patient treatment , the patient can temporarily store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum period of 3 days outside of the fridge and not above 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with graduation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a past@@ ed label , making it possible to measure partial quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with gra@@ y@@ amed treatment must be initiated under the supervision of doctors , which have experience in treating patients with the above indications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29 In veter@@ inary studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for use at humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced cervi@@ cal weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • to obtain new information , influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • by request from E@@ MEA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) - the danger of a coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) is - if you have previously performed such a blood cl@@ ut@@ rop@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms again during further treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the beginning of treatment with se@@ amed amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin was reported very rarely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y , it will break your treatment with th@@ amed treatment and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed can be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of death could be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically exposed coron@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age signs due to insufficient cardiac performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of stre@@ amed amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your gra@@ y@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of a coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are a cancer patient , a@@ amed amed like a growth factor for blood cells , and in certain circumstances can have a negative effect on the tumor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an orthop@@ edic surgery , you should study the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia prior to treatment and be treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / applying it or applying it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and make sure that the drug works properly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating physician will carry out regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) , both in women after menop@@ ause and in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to treat the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ construc@@ ts bone substance ) was again norm@@ alized in the blood , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with elderly women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , or any other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ cla@@ sta manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drugs side effects are explained and indicated when they should consult the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company a permit for the placing of A@@ cla@@ sta in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The prevention of pregnancy and breast@@ feeding , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg a@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operative care of hip frac@@ tures ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first a@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for these patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elderly patient ( ≥ 65 years ) is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data are missing for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid initiation of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental examination using appropriate preventive dental treatment before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the doctor treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was comparable to 2.6 % and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) are listed in table 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders that were associated with a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the ag@@ cla@@ m and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels below the normal range of patients ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after frac@@ ture frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was generally treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area , with A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved through the application of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified with either a frac@@ ture assessment ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the s@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ - 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older , compared to placebo patients , reduced by 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 7 % , the skull by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were removed one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture when compared to placebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods during study duration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value , after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B @-@ CT@@ X was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the total mortal spread was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to the placebo treatment at the total stock@@ pile and neck @-@ neck at all time points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to the placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study was random@@ ized to 50@@ 8 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when entering the study ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day , during 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month study were included in the follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at participated in the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the plasma level quickly rose to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rapid bi@@ phas@@ eal disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ - 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early phases of decay ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total @-@ body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes was reduced by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduced @-@ dose of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Aci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ) and was 75 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest un@@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body@@ weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the four@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) was administered well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use were an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of the skeleton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known , which could affect the present statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone of the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is made fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ ordered which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / applied or applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine that is known to the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you have plenty of fluids in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have broken the hips recently , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than one year and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss A@@ cla@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before completing the therapy with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical signs due to low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps , or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially around the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

persistent pain and / or not cur@@ ative wounds in the mouth or jaw@@ s were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures recently , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks following the operative care of hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid initiation of the effect of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia can develop whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of a@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and one or more of them
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was used as a supporting remedy for setting up smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A ? the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can boost the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , p@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicines used in patients that need health and not cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the AR@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in patients who - besides obesity - have no visible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of additional treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied at 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.2 % in patients who were in addition to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irritation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the placing of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is inadequate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with increased output Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the AL@@ T levels are up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops symptoms related to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , colon@@ izing , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to continue treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be guided by clinical evaluation until the clinical assessment has been taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be stir@@ red by fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in reduced by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , about an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , however , doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients are concerned about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable diagnosis should be taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cyclo@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 ; sometimes &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare ( not available from this data ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to temporary changes in the lens and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T sti@@ ege on the three times the upper limit of the normal range often appeared as often as under placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch was rarely reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , however , if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summari@@ zing analysis of messages un@@ desirable from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was carried out in the groups treated with comparison medications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ radi@@ ators ) which in the animal model lead to increased insulin sensitivity of liver and fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ amine in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years in order to study the period up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month optimization phase was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the treated group was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small 18 weeks study of type 2 diab@@ etics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and a slight increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the total plasma matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on while lower values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cyclo@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fold ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mean plasma elimination time of imm@@ utable Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ em@@ el@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) was induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the inscription &quot; 30 &quot; on one side and the &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; inscription on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a further two @-@ year study , the effects of met@@ form@@ in combination therapy with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , a combination of total mortal , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies suggests that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of reports of un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the packaging supplement of the medicine , the manufacturer &apos;s name and address , which is responsible for the approval of the concerned batch , must be stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2005 , the pharmaceutical entrepreneur will submit an additional 6 month Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) and then annual P@@ SU@@ R@@ s , up to a different CH@@ MP decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in is measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the dose of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , in the treatment of diabetes , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to author@@ ise the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , if a quick initial impact is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds , ensuring that the entire dose is inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved substantially thanks to an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change concerning starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( insulin , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his physician , as such trips may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always consult with other drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes treatment , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dis@@ ruption of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Gel@@ som@@ ely - Peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur during insulin therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degenerative disorders , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with defici@@ encies are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total dose is up to 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane glass bottle is taken out of the refrigerator - to rise the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ her@@ ed according to the operating instructions for the first use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always consult with other drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ ary with the injection needle upwards • knock a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you keep the injection needle upwards , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Now , from the tip of the injection needle , drop a drop of insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Connect the cap back to the finished pen , that the digit 0 is opposite the metering brand ( figure E ) • Check that the push button is fully pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , turn the cap until the push button is fully pressed • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ ary horizontal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the push button cannot move outward , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the push button moves outward while you rotate the closing cap • The scale underneath the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review a set dose • Record the number on the cap directly next to the dosage marker • Record the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise insulin will escape from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have been mistaken , set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then remove the cap and set it up again , so that the 0 of the metering brand is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it may be incorrect • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining amount of scale to estimate how much insulin is still left .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , acet@@ ab@@ p@@ id cans need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of quickly acting insulin needs to be wound up first , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his physician , as such trips may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients showed that an intraven@@ ous @-@ induced mac@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.3 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total dose is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and juven@@ ile ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the injection needle continues upwards , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure C ) • While the injection needle continues to rise upwards , press the push button in the direction of the arrow ( figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be extracted from the tip of the injection needle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Connect the cap back to the finished pen , that the digit 0 is opposite the metering token ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check that the push button is fully pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit signs of crystalline rock including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or gi@@ mmi@@ cks ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater urine @-@ crystal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months , there may still be rheum@@ atism ; therefore , it is recommended that at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic , further medicines are used to prevent rheum@@ atism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ al@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( pseu@@ do drugs ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ thy@@ roid ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were at 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients with a daily dose of 80 mg ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 13@@ 4 patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ ination ( including a disease known from the patient &apos;s history , and / or arthritis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , if the serum levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other drugs , it may result in acute rheum@@ atism during the beginning of the treatment because the reduction of serum levels can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) increase the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ ary treatment and subsequent clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was not performed any interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % and AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x showed an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a calcium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) is delayed and a decline of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant changes in AU@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include any side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably secure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a numerical higher incidence of cardiac events reported by the investig@@ ator observed cardiovascular events in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term long @-@ term studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could be detected in the treatment groups with the medicine and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were mentioned below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 2 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events related to long @-@ term and long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 , or at a lower frequency : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ sp@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
placebo ( n = 13@@ 4 ) and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.6 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 0.2 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were consolidated for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and persi@@ sted throughout the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the results of the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ litter , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the top notes by month 24 in 54 % of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally by 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ dispro@@ portion@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cases of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after in@@ gest@@ ing simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 μ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentrations observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma bonding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms showed that these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 and 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) and its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion across the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as un@@ modified ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 25 % ) and other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specific patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild to moderate or severe kidney failure the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ of al@@ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function at 13.@@ 2 μ y / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes did not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metaboli@@ tes after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly doses treated group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at high doses , which were approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was associated with lowering the upward performance and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the offspring of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with expos@@ ures , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with expos@@ ures , which fertili@@ sed about 13 @-@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 2 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of the open extension study of Phase 3 demonstrated that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .

the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes did not significantly change in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly doses treated group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the authorisation for placing the drug has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in Version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human drugs with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on safety data , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mile@@ stones ( Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • at request of E@@ MEA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the crystal formation is prevented and thus reached with time a reduction of the discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine • if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration as a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital condition in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rheum@@ atism at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat sensation and joint swelling ) , wait until the pla@@ sty attack starts before you begin with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / applying it or applying it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using drugs that may appear one of the following substances because interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the transport ti@@ ghtness and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed so that you can check if you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken over@@ dose , contact your doctor or the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , take it as soon as possible unless the next dose is imminent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you break AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ ic acid concentration may rise again , and your discomfort can wor@@ sen because new elem@@ ental crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company prescri@@ bes data originating from earlier studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increased vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who solely received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also stipul@@ ates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , required for preventing bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ab@@ norm@@ alities ( swal@@ lowed abdom@@ en ) and oxygen rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may not be used in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only to take with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty should be given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doctor should therefore draw attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible les@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge or pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of serious bre@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the appearance of symptoms , that refer to a bre@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are transmitted to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , including some severe and complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no data available to give evidence , whether the rejection of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a ortho@@ don@@ tic intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical evaluation by the doctor treating physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient , based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be instructed that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet next morning after notic@@ ing their failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the day of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before beginning of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before using other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , most of the reports stem from cancer patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless concentrations of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum levels of ≤ 0.2 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main action of 1.@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ B2 D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures across oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.1 % ) compared to placebo group was achieved with the percentage of patients who suffered one or more frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter persi@@ sted ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ ding studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this study , the daily application of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability amounts to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in healthy subjects the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution studies on rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes itself after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ activity was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous application of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it influences the elimination of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a meal the mean surface below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an time until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; biot@@ rans@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly absorbed in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ B2 D@@ 3 Hydro@@ xy@@ B2 and then in the kidney to 1,@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ B2 D@@ 3 , the bio@@ active form , metaboli@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively mar@@ inated vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy volunteers , the medi@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine amounted to 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
characteristics in patients &quot; pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate that is not deposited in the bone quickly ex@@ cre@@ tes over the urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients and physicians must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time as a supplement , as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the bright yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out in order to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily depend on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be insp@@ ected before switching over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks following the transplantation in Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposition in the immediate stage of the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the an@@ agra@@ f dose schemes can take several days until ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral advent therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as daily gift in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further dose adjustments can later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change after transplantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral advent therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ould a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipient of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f should be converted to one once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph so this conversion in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has to take place in relation to the entire daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection must begin once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients did not have clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pulmon@@ ary , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver function disorders , dosage adjustments in patients with reduced liver function can be a reduction of the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with reduced kidney function , since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of serum levels and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in- to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases , using full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ mirrors controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus fe@@ at levels during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f . dose adjustment changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical practice , treatment levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually associated with liver transplantation in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in patients with heart transplan@@ ts at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a row of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Advent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f are available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult cardiac tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers and tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers in childhood .
taking herbal supplements which may lead to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is to avoid taking herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid loading and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we offer hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance and lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinct interaction was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole and flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ pan antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly do@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can compromise their metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the balance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions about contrac@@ eption measures are taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not provide an indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be identified precisely because of the health of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of available data is not appreciated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well as known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is frequently elevated in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal corneal cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms , including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucleus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g@@ amma @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks of the Advent group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
the patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the An@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 females and 11 men ) and the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 females and 19 men ) died .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f , in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibodies , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , were compared with 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death and tran@@ spl@@ ant loss ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the RE@@ SE@@ F group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 15.@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) .
the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ ph C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 5.0 % ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 5.0 % reduction interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f tablets applied twice a day after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant according to pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 175 patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observed in large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f reports over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first year following the tran@@ spl@@ ant , chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection was less frequent after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % of patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients coated by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . ) An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.2 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.@@ 3 % ) patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pancre@@ atic Plan@@ tation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients with pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation which resulted in a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) , 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections ; bone mar@@ mentation ; additional talent of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab leading to lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and recent gra@@ ft ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . ) An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rite level and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a reinforcement of the metabolism led by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly through bile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f ( mg : mg : mg : mg : mg : mg once daily ) at a rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus fe@@ at levels during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Advent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 37 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Advent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total 34 patients from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , while only 6 Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients needed another therapy ( B@@ ech@@ stein et al . , transplantation 2004 ; 77 : 12@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent is used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital thro@@ mbo@@ sis caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether it is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding , in case of surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was placed , which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new sep@@ is@@ o@@ ds with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer before the pain and acute impairment are removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the risk is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment process , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage rate should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest in the first 20 expos@@ ures and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ posi@@ tional days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian known inhibit@@ ors development was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II to another to re@@ occur ( low @-@ ti@@ um ) inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences with the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AD@@ R@@ s ( 5 patients ) which had previously untreated patients had head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 0.2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 0.2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously untreated patients undergoing a clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a prolonged peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared which were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X , factor X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients same or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which makes P@@ SU@@ R@@ s necessary every 6 months , to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited was officially approved by the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , however , breast , brain , bone or soft tissue ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a kind of virus , which was genetically altered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on testing the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tumours has advantages for the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered ingredient release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever and inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membranes ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and stopped as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms , which were reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard sc@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after sounding the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use for 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of completion of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , ex@@ or@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ha@@ oline etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient collective , and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment of hypertension , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the headache ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder hal@@ ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be suspended at least 48 hours before performing mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce it to its extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies revealed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases there may be a presum@@ ption that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary mic@@ ple@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pu@@ pi@@ l rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ her@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measured parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dose can cause further symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of the application in plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the floating equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects were ill @-@ metaboli@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 , the regulatory application described is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing eyes while simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the s@@ wollen drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor if there are symptoms or diseases diagnosed with you following the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Cardi@@ ovascular disease • Cardi@@ ac disease • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transport ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines In the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze results in di@@ zz@@ iness or reduced attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , di@@ zz@@ iness with increased physical activity , in cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values was also very seldom reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( among them four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day with one or without a meal to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease progression , and may be resum@@ ed and resum@@ ed when re@@ appearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for prolonged treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases there may be a presum@@ ption that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) and mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) were the most frequent reported side effects reported more frequently than in the placebo .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ her@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45@@ mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered for ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measured parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all the ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected that the symptoms of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n occur in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an improvement of the Ju@@ ck@@ irrit@@ ations by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) , over 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer detect any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ gly@@ cans , titanium dioxide , macro go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , macro go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available which support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with a@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metaboli@@ se , is identical to that of children who are normally metabolic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ car@@ act@@ ose absorption or in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported as in patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine clinical trials ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials do not affect psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively allevi@@ ate the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that limit metaboli@@ se .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation , after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 . in various single dose studies , the efficacy of AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ lass bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with a application injec@@ tor for preparations for application with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to take once a day in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate can be taken for taking without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported as in patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the processed tablet is removed without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the G@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us was used as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically proven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this badly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and under black ( adults 18 % ) and the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or an@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet proved bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for reducing des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 30 single dose study involving adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irritation tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metaboli@@ se , is identical to that of children who are normally metabolic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ car@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in the placebo ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no adverse events in patients between 6 and 11 years was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to child and adult population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in different single dose studies , the efficacy of AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. acknowledged the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) for the approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread from humans to humans , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the immune system is able to train fast antibodies in a contact with a flu virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as alien ) is puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine , in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines used to treat adults and children over four years using the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed only if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aids can not cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and illnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase , which was used with low dose , was compared to other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) , or the changes in the viral load after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the medicines A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , there was a more severe decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous Prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ ni@@ otic or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , including cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are broken down in the same way as am@@ em@@ ase and are harmful to health in high blood concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovery of the immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of am@@ o@@ ases in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were not detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under extraordinary circumstances , as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the placing of am@@ als across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , nas@@ az@@ ure capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters should be administered along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of ammon@@ ites should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ites as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore nas@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If nas@@ ac@@ ri@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying additive of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum of 24@@ 00 mg of ammon@@ ite that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ac@@ re@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants were not studied in children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ac@@ re@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ammon@@ ites during the ing@@ es@@ tion of ammon@@ ites ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ o@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapies have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the specialist information for this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 a simultaneous administration of am@@ nas@@ al and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who use this medicine at the same time , am@@ o@@ ases can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of ammon@@ ites ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with ammon@@ ites , the efficacy of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the kind of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with ammon@@ ites , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , A@@ gener@@ ase should be suspended for a duration of 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to therapy drugs , which were associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. a higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop inflammatory responses to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology was adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol use , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase may not be combined with medicines whose agents are metaboli@@ zed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of ammon@@ ites , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in attempting to compensate the de@@ hum@@ ed plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions to the liver were frequently observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of ammon@@ ites can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has already enrolled Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the ammon@@ ia virus and , if possible , to check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with ammon@@ ium avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
52 % humili@@ ated if ammon@@ ite ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if ammon@@ ium avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ites and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a close monitoring recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ c component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ ton@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants and existing limited data suggests that N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in could possibly sun@@ k the serum concentration of ammon@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ a@@ vir@@ is could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if these drugs are used together caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out since an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous application of ammon@@ ite and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin lead to an increase in the plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with r@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is necessary for clinical reasons , when it is necessary to admini@@ ster the vari@@ ase , a minimum of half of the recommended dose is recommended , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ blown avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ Cluster ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ blown avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs , when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ac@@ re@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) can lead to degradation of the ammon@@ ion plasma level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake with dor@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) the fluor@@ o@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of ac@@ re@@ ase with k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma level can be expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as plasma increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis the combined use of these drugs with am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the levels , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ites ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is advisable while applying A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 fa@@ ec@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with ammon@@ ites , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given at the moment , such as the ammon@@ ite dose can be adjusted if ammon@@ ite is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous administration of Var@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional administration of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternate methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is also recommended by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , ammon@@ ite @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if ammon@@ ites are transferred into breast milk in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ tation , showed a decreased increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of ammon@@ ites to the dam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment rup@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medication used simultaneously for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as the changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients including a loss of peripheral and bilateral fatty tissue ; increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue ( hypertension ) and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , not pre @-@ treated subjects treated with ammon@@ ia in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ thema migran@@ s or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with ammon@@ ites had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors such as advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop inflammatory responses to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of am@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; the exception provided increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K levels ( Grade 3 and 4 ) that were observed in patients who received an@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and ga@@ g pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene with the result of a formation of im@@ mature and non infectious viral particles .
anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of ammon@@ ites against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossil @-@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of fossi@@ ls with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 5 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ blown avi@@ r / 100 mg of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for fossi@@ ls V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V or I@@ 50@@ V or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F + 14@@ 7@@ a / V ; I@@ 5@@ 4@@ A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always extract the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic data analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to interpret results of a resistance test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amm@@ uni@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data for resistance resistance between ammon@@ ites and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants for all 4 types of fossil @-@ resistance path@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment path@@ ways ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) and sac@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) and sac@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and animal pran@@ ay@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , ammon@@ ite retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early depar@@ ting of a failing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ; a random@@ ised open trial with PI pre@@ treated ( 600 mg twice daily ) and a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI mainly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r versus time @-@ adjusted average changes in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ stop threshold of 0.@@ 4@@ log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ roasted A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution was taken twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , consideration should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( max ) to the maximum serum concentration of ammon@@ ites is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ oplas@@ tic ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of ammon@@ ites with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of ammon@@ ites 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of ammon@@ ites from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall dosage in the Ste@@ ady state via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of am@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ite exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the solution , ammon@@ ite is 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of ammon@@ ites and chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these treatment schemes lead to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r plasma levels , comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1,@@ 200 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals containing the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of the human exposure after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ amm@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated , and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mice @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither presum@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in the clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during oral administration nor after the end of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
systemic plasma exposure significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans however were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying additive of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of am@@ ni@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum of 24@@ 00 mg of ammon@@ ite that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 27 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of ammon@@ ites , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma that were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if ammon@@ ium avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ites and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a close monitoring recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would lower .
if these drugs are used together caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out since an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster the vari@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine and di@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by ammon@@ ium , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) the fluor@@ o@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
simultaneous administration of Var@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decline in AU@@ C and C@@ min of ammon@@ ites by 22 % or respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in po@@ sterity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , ammon@@ ite retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be considered in therapy optimisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall dosage in the Ste@@ ady state via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al clear@@ ances of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of ammon@@ ites and chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , malign@@ ant h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , responding to 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of human exposure after twice daily gift of 1200 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ o @-@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , mice @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither presum@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the treated animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results suggest that the metaboli@@ sation routes are not fully mature in young animals , so that am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) , adults and children from 4 years old are indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for inclusion of patients with PI were not treated with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ites as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore nas@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , because no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for accepting and low @-@ dose k@@ nights , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a dose adjustment for ammon@@ ites is not considered necessary , an application of an@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ in content , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that am@@ o@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of dying from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be suspended in the long term , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drugs - 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of ammon@@ ites , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ oplas@@ tic Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake with dor@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am produces significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , ammon@@ ite @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if ammon@@ ites are transferred into breast milk in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ tation , showed a decreased 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medication used simultaneously for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossil @-@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early depar@@ ting of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , consideration should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ousin volume , and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of ammon@@ ites from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not elu@@ ci@@ dated , and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
systemic plasma exposure significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans however were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of kni@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in order to increase the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor , and your treatment history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the above drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sters ) , make sure you have read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there is no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for the efficacy of children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ regeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can perform certain medicines that can cause serious side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ to@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perhaps carry out additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that HIV positive women should breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances , in order to avoid the transmission of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines No studies have been carried out on the impact of the aura on the driving ability , or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after consultation with your doctor , please consult your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg ammon@@ ica twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 85 Dam@@ it A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the total daily dose you prescribed for your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a larger amount of an@@ gener@@ ase than you should have taken , if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it once you think about it and then continue taking it as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in treating HIV infection , it is not always possible to say whether any side effects can be caused by am@@ using , by other medicines that are taken simultaneously or by the HIV disease itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness sensation , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious in nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ ber &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ regeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination treatment , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( weak@@ ening of bone tissue as a result of inadequate blood supply of the bone ) may develop bone disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ) , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after ac@@ re@@ ase , otherwise the effects of am@@ o@@ ases may be dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 94 So that A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the total daily dose you prescribed for your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it once you think about it and then continue taking it as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nas@@ ol@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution were not covered with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the application of low doses of k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to strengthen the effect &#91; boo@@ padding &#93; of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake , no dosage recommendations can be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution , or use prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l while taking A@@ gener@@ ase solution ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may observe you possibly on side effects associated with the Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for interfer@@ ing in , especially if you have kidney or liver illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 111 If you can perform certain medicines that can cause serious side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ to@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perhaps carry out additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ron@@ avi@@ r solution ( intake ) or supple@@ mental gly@@ co@@ l , while taking A@@ gener@@ ase ( see A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important information about certain other components of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake The solution for intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can cause side effects in high doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l may cause a number of side effects including var@@ ic@@ ose , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of the red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , special precau@@ tions are needed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten taking A@@ regeneration , take it once you think about it and then continue taking it as before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness sensation , vomiting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be serious in nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ ber &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , meth@@ rin 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , acet@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l 400 , sac@@ char@@ ine sodium , natural pe@@ pper@@ mint aroma , le@@ mon@@ en@@ tho@@ l , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate d@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas it is up to 16 weeks to apply five times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas it is repeated five weeks a week during one or two weeks of treatment with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered onto the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas demonstrated a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ canal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or if an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , moist@@ ened skin area until the cream is completely covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection , or gra@@ ft vs. host reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily pro@@ sth@@ esis was performed , two cases of serious phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ pe leading to circumcision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases heavy local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases has also been observed under proper application severe local skin irritation that have made a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impairment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ ph@@ ine area , no clinical experiences have occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data may indicate an increased rate of contra@@ ction reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has demonstrated a lower effectiveness in this patient population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the treatment may be judged about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is currently no data available for long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very limited data are available on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face , and the scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 minor les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulation properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects go to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , fet@@ ching or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although non @-@ recurring serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved , no recommendation is given to the application during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cra@@ ckers ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include discomfort at the application site , with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od spread out of a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
this review of clinical signs indicated that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème often resulted in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) and ero@@ de ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the study plan , this study showed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in serious er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe atro@@ phy ( 13 % ) and severe cas@@ u@@ alties ( 19 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accidental or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy in relation to complete healing of the cra@@ mp@@ ons in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the patients were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a complete healing was achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 in placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five weeks of application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions in a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permitted indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ted 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ h half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ month study , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice , in three days a week , did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low system absorption of human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and the anus ( anus ) - superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slow growing type of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if left untreated , it may result in hi@@ ring , especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their previous life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or any other similar preparations before you start treatment , consult your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not in@@ war@@ dly . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which will give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are subsi@@ ded , you can continue the treatment process@@ . o In@@ form your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or difficulties during withdrawal of the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased occur@@ ence of skin con@@ stri@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if other drugs have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts during the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after intercourse ( not before ) perform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , since it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od enters the breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of cra@@ ckers , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the cra@@ ckers and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
males with gra@@ dients under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What must you consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks each week , 5 days a week a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream apply to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent side effects ( expecting more than 1 out of 10 patients ) common side effects ( in less than 1 out of 100 patients ) can expect rare side effects ( in less than 1 out of 10 patients ) Very rare side effects ( in case of less than 1 out of 10,000 patients ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist about it immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more vulnerable to infections ; it can cause you to get a blue stain faster , or it can cause fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually it is easier skin reactions , which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the location of the application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , skin formation , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ redness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the place of application ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , skin irritation , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor , which possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was mainly studied , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is used to observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the European Commission to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary from Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , who possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is little experience in re@@ starting treatment after a longer break , it has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously advised because of the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ ents ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments do not lead to direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma that were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are performed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory passages and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurring , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Un@@ desirable Drug Eff@@ ects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg IV once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version with a severe form of ser@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis mostly within one month to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no det@@ ectable antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with no Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate , and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of FE@@ V to be expected and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me demonstrated an improvement in lung function and ability in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant during this period , and the absolute lung volume increases further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) and no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the middle follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental develop@@ mental speed after the Z @-@ score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental develop@@ mental speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a phase 4 study , examinations on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg IV once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a substitute alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar , as was the case with elderly and less strongly affected patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the specified period , the holder of authorization for the placing of goods has completed the following study programme whose results are the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , this register will detect safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms and data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which sp@@ li@@ ts certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , is completely absent or totally absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have encountered a serious allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is each side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , including prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tips for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to use and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - unconditional involvement of upper respiratory passages and lungs in the past , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial oils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea , joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Ref@@ lec@@ ted • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the packaging supplement will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer to be stored for 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the di@@ lution was controlled under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepare the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , the number of fluid @-@ th@@ inning bottles to be dil@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily onto other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy before chemotherapy alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when administered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or any other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer time of operation in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) in 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months when performing C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in both studies patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta prolonged survival compared to the previous drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the approval of Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to approve the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each glass bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adequate volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for the predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with LO@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for overwhelming panel epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a Kor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gift as well as on the day after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) and as@@ part@@ ame tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination will take place in the presence of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are suitable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient adju@@ sts the value before treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped when in patients after 2 c@@ anned foods a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so - at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times of the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase values of &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ iner and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ logy number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ , and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ ic number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as seen in the previous treatments ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ologic and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous seizure of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ valent high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible reproduction of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment procedure to obtain counsel@@ ing on sperm conservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , caution is advisable when treating high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid at a high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
because there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , heavy birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , unless absolutely required and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the start of the treatment to bring in consultation with regard to the blocking of the sperm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed sur@@ passes the mother &apos;s milk , and un@@ desirable effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who were random@@ ized , were random@@ ised to su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) in phase 2 ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.@@ 3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ al values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been reported cases of acute kidney failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been reported cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ sensitive metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) and thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS : a multi@@ center random@@ ised single @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma showed a clin@@ ically significant benefit to survival compared to patients that were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients , who received the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the use of the L@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the common C@@ is@@ p@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 Pati@@ ents ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control room .
a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( n = 17@@ 2 ; 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months ; adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 ; p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28@@ ,@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival revealed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = inten@@ to @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority ; with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ submission threshold of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28@@ ,@@ 9 % ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % ; p = 0.@@ 00@@ 2 ) .
patients also needed less and less the gift of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.0 % versus 7.@@ 0 % ; p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours after the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma amounts to 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , which had been given intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months , Tes@@ im@@ it@@ ary changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not neglected , the retention times and conditions after the preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dissolve the content of the 100 mg / ml milk bottles with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preservatives . this results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each glass bottle has to be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , reduced fat diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who are allergic to All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric acid @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and young people under 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since or@@ list@@ at is absorbed only minim@@ ally , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage of these drugs must be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea , it is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a decrease of the ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K remained in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vit@@ am@@ in@@ ic intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the gift of a single dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of taken fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events voluntarily were reported from a population of some extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; † It is plau@@ sible , that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a fast re@@ formation of any systemic effects can be traced back to the anti@@ bacterial properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the therapeutic effect decreases in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , blocking the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ori , reduced fat diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight ( table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
with waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able for 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ c and at very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients receiving the minimal systemic absorption , two primary metaboli@@ tes were identified , namely , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , hurri@@ can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 years with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height , or are overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if these diseases do not initially cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take any medicine , and if you need drugs for high blood pressure , the dosage may be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set your calorie and fat boundaries , see further helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave a meal or a meal contains no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only act if the food contains fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get used to your body in new eating habits , start the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dietary ker@@ chiefs are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • dietary fat is reduced , in order to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember to ask your doctor in advance , if you are not used to physical activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • all@@ i should not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t notice any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of application by all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • When taking a successful weight loss , it is not about switching the diet quickly and then back to old habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , grab the capsule intake . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , since you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutrition @-@ related side effects : • Start a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the amount of calories and fat you can take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Ke@@ ep out of reach of children after the exp@@ iry date stated on the box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ cones which serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing different serious diseases , such as : • hypertension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk of these diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently healthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which quantity is suitable for you , take out the information below that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight at approximately 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • &quot; Low @-@ calorie physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and to comply with it . • Sen@@ se to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ ori@@ - and fatty alcohol and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are excessive nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in chemotherapy alone , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vomiting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in chemotherapy alone , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vomiting ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 19@@ 1 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong em@@ eto@@ id chemotherapy , due to a cancer and for preventing nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colon as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable while simultaneous application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or those tend to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not used to treat or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the targeted activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds - a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ ter@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have a significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of pregnant women , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant pregn@@ ancies , unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ is ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events , as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aly@@ sis studies were not carried out , but a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 were given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received the 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron received on day 1 intraven@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results of studies with chemotherapy @-@ based chemotherapy , and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ id chemotherapy , are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the objective of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption After an intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range from 0.@@ - 90 μ y / kg in patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ dispro@@ portion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the medi@@ oc@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine . pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the overall body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29@@ ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ ist exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence indicates that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to 30@@ ples of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands , and skin tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ is is intended for one @-@ time application , relevance of these results will be minim@@ ized for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this authorisation for the placing of information must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the medicines approved within this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver illness , which is caused by viral infection ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damage ; moreover , the values of the Li@@ ver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the formation of the active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data proving the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effects , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment had been adjusted to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA is re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the CH@@ MP to forbi@@ d the authorization for placing on the market ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , concerns have also been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug develops an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately validated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected areas ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or possibly caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because alarm goes against this type of infection possibly not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients aged nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung to the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo discussed the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected skin les@@ ions , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar rates of response : when the results of both studies were taken together at home customers , about 90 % of both groups participated in the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ ess ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the place of the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small det@@ oxi@@ fication , abra@@ sions or wound wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again , and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection commen@@ ced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treatment of infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected position occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of the simultaneous application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical treatments on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations encountered in the skin or infected superficial wounds in humans ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 The mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical treatment in patients , dose adjustments are not required when topical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding effect on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues or should be continued or terminated with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to consider between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go reported was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irritation on the administration site , which affects approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode Eff@@ ect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin ; a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ab@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ an@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear critically at least some infection forms due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , a consultation should be targeted by experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event of failure on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients , before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic absorption in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of reduced skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in trials of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymp@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats @-@ micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has reached up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ imp@@ ed skin ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be used in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if problems arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a Gaza strip unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium p@@ ou@@ ch that contains 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereas a protection against Hepatitis B may not be reached until the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the im@@ muni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consists of two doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after obtaining the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine that has been approved since 1996 , and has been the authorized vaccine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the application of ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration one month after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 month gap between the two injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of ambi@@ rix in the whole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ med vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , and the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a collection formulation is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immune @-@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis AIDS vacc@@ ination , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately after the injection of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses may be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these injection routes should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis , Ambi@@ rix may be sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate intraven@@ ous injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- and ac@@ ell@@ ular poly@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study comprising 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vaccine ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ z@@ iness was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle with 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test persons who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and pain was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years old vaccine the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose and a month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 28@@ 9 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 according to the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical trial study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life is administered at the same time with the collection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- and ac@@ ell@@ ular poly@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conver@@ sions , as for the earlier formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is examined both before and after the examination by eye on any foreign particles , and / or physically visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state @-@ owned batch sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorised laboratory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a steady treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete series of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vacc@@ ination doses Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those found after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If your child has an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has been shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , an allergic reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly protect against Hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead he will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine , with a reduced content of effective components , is usually given one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vaccine series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defence , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response is to vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has been given or has been planned in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate parts and as many as possible extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not administered , unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) , if you have an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the inc@@ ision site or redness • mat@@ z@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( up to 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted doses ) : • swelling at the injection site , fever ( over 38 ° C ) • F@@ ade@@ dness • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other side effects , reported days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 blocked doses ) are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include loc@@ alised or extended r@@ ashes which can be it@@ ching or ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eyes and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant walking &quot; , multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels may cause discomfort , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea and stomach pain . abnormal bleeding or bru@@ ising ( blue spots ) caused by waste of the blood plat@@ el@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
23 Check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child greatly affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this packing supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data that has become known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , because ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ze is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ ze could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , mal@@ function or flavor , abdominal pain , vomiting , skin rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ aps was effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , too high ammon@@ ia levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ze was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first life month ) , there is an indication of the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for babies , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosing of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.3 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events were assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis ( severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia ) and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity when administered intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed , that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen for each gram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ ric oxide ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein reduced diet were 98 % survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by taking a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were measured 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was detected .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours , approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the approved product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no compla@@ ined effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gar@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who have not yet swal@@ lowed tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns and infants with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosing of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , it occurred to les@@ ions in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain @-@ cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis ( severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia ) and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defici@@ encies are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ules , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the sti@@ cky waste products that accumulate after consuming proteins in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases ab@@ norm@@ alities , head@@ aches , taste disorders , impairment of hearing impaired , memory disorders , and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or contact your hospital for an appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in the blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , headache , nausea , mal@@ function , kidney function , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous lab results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the exp@@ iry date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may no longer be used after the exp@@ iry date on the box and the container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a Magen@@ to ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the measuring spoon , to remove excess gran@@ ulate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ opla@@ sty is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , e.g. in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow , and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ opla@@ sty in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like ritu@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ opla@@ sty was just as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ opla@@ sty was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ opla@@ sty may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other Hi@@ ri@@ dine or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as for people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commission for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the placing of angi@@ ox in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non - ST ) inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) , an emergency intervention or an early intervention is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a stu@@ ds of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ opla@@ sty has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and administered intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is re@@ examined 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of intraven@@ ous gift of frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Reli@@ able hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • Active hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while in principle bleeding occurs everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din once again reached the level existing prior to treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the knowledge of the efficacy mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te extraction inhibit@@ or ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , fet@@ ching or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tional or ano@@ x apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding performed significantly less frequently than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ n plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other , less frequently observed blood cell populations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ turing points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following data about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ date in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding performed significantly less under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparative group of He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes listed in table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ mb@@ in is trapped in the liquid phase or in t@@ inn@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly split@@ ting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , serum @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ sty thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ sty thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ sty thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ sty thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia was not induced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is documented by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI was carried out in the patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ date should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the arm A of AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; * Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l before angi@@ ography or before PCI 1 A AC@@ U@@ ITY bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ ito @-@ ne@@ ural , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pe@@ p@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is expected to go through a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary metaboli@@ te resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 bond of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by thro@@ mb@@ ine is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elimination occurs in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a process of first order , with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional research on safety sp@@ at@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 @-@ times of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects as a result of long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ opathic co@@ ag@@ ulation were observed after short @-@ term exposure , even with a much higher dosage , not observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution is not carried out under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours to be stored at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ml of sterile water for injection purposes are given in a penetration bottle of angi@@ ox , and slightly wa@@ ved until everything has dissolved and the solution is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 ml are taken from the glass bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml in order to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood , or cannot process insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter time of operation than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to work insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % was observed in insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ ted by continuous in@@ fusion into the abdominal wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of the effect of the insulin , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switching a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change when the treatment plan is converted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics belong to the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics like beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin sur@@ passes the human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter the mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ bed after oral use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , and can subsequently occur a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with loss of consciousness can be given by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ cos@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly @-@ trained person or by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the time of operation is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ome effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ healing effect as human insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin , and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ healing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data it was evident that at an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , like in human normal insulin , is given before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) given before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin that was given 30 minutes ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ine that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
