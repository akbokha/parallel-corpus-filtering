&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the whole &amp; URL ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can paste into translation texts directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions , please refer to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up .... Open the card tools and select the desired modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a list of default settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note , if you have more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click on Tools menu . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash or the list of cr@@ ashes if available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module An@@ View Filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be accessed in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ pane Fil@@ l . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory at local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the tre@@ em@@ ap shows a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle switching over View color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can define if it is available at all or if there is enough space to display ( whereby presentation errors occur by restrictions on the sign of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is possible for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frames to create rect@@ angles that are as square as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the level of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind was developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the module Picture Gallery , a dialog box opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page , in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Pictures per line has a slider and a script , to set the number of images every line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display the file name of the image , specify whether the file names are shown in the pictures in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the images in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of the images is shown in the images in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fol@@ der Fol@@ der , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Save to HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a turn field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box original images , you can copy the original images to the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the Com@@ mentary text box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the pictures in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the navig@@ ator can be specified here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the standard browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers based on Moz@@ illa . for example you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard , or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Use elements and attributes , are correctly represented with the characteristic of this out@@ dated browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information about the browser used , and the operating system in each individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , assess and correct your photos . editing skills can be easily expanded using K@@ DE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional features are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG Export and ICC color management workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all , programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu will open a page in the error report system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; is a project supported by a community . that is to help users and developers help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; gt ; then we would like to encourage you to answer other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage , to get news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to get involved , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ cam ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; panel ; will you use as an al@@ ot library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images , as base folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no pictures as symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the Base Fol@@ der , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shell File Backup : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ on@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the R@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ view , and Ro@@ h workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . older cameras may also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports a permanently increasing number of cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow this connection is dated now . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview pictures from digi@@ cam . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things to &amp; about , is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add a function to a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ tise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , over the horizontal separation line or another application window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is shown in the symbol view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that have been edited by &amp; gt ; can be sorted by the folders in which the album was created in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have created a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the appearing menu you will have to select or copy multiple photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album features in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album collections : are a method of selecting your albums so that you can choose from a shared name . if you want to add or delete albums from the collection , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Album date : when you sort your albums by date with View albums , sort by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or that of the average of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ mare preview quot ; additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections cannot be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album for the first time , you must wait short while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this in which you can use all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , can be edited via settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview pictures feature help window , which seem to rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo editing displays your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , slides or editing images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; gt ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and the program from the opening menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image , so this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 names from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a photo taken from &amp; panel ; delete it , it will be moved to the bin by &amp; k@@ de ; move F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete if you rather want to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gt ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in Picture View . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date page to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . therefore , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold out parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key list box ; so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . you can also import your keywords in other programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key phrase ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you click on an existing keyword then this will become the sub@@ stit@@ word of this keyword .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it there . then , a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word quot ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the pictures you have selected using a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My key word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can display a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it , one for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was done etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have completed a photo with keywords , this will be shown in the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the right @-@ click context menu of the photo , and select Del@@ ete from the menu menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the box frame which indicates the time unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if you find nothing , then the lamp turns red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the Ri@@ der on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will find a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search that will always filter what you entered as a search criterion . after you &apos;ve saved it appear the filter in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the results will be selected in my search list in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Search Edit , the search form will appear again with the search information entered . if you select Add As advanced search , there will be more rules for search . see the Advanced search tool for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the pop @-@ up menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; panel ; s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . each rule can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... links . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sketch : free @-@ handed paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press it in or out and move it while you press the left mouse button . push it while you press the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The illuminated table is added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens .
from the preview bar you can draw the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to quickly get out of a picture series . if you are using pairs of pairs from the tool@@ bar , then use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to view the visible area of the picture , you need to hold them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photographs . we focus on the process for digital fot@@ ograph@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management records , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , and exports content that holds a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data via data . metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a specific photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , you can use very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you will need to switch to a bigger drive sometime .
holiday pictures can be organized quickly from your location unless you were in one year on the same place . if you make enough photos then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the file &apos;s settings page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be added to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? this provides &amp; digi@@ tization ; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the actual work starts , as you should select keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , key words , as you often name in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you import catalo@@ ged images from another source with embedded keywords then &amp; digi@@ tise ; automatically build the tree for you or change the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; panel ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I &apos;m telling you this of the landing place of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream to have associations . you may even hear the silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell you a story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; Fix ; you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as labelling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries then these cap@@ tions will tell you a second time for publishing and / or the title of the web gallery .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now moves with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become more profound in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day in the near future you can virtually repeat your trips using Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; Favor@@ kam , as information should be deposited : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph , for example to protect the name of the photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examples can be the title : employee photographer , freelance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendor ) : use the vendor field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations can be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image , and it will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : plate failure , board failure , electrical shocks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread Aber@@ deen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs lost on the street or brand . these types of losses are the same which can happen in traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ms . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it works under Windows and Linux , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8,5 GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disc@@ othe@@ ques retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy study
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may cause severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed Mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . however , remember that not every connector strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for lap@@ tops and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power supply , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be saved up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally you should always remember all the cables before you go to holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suited as a solution to a local data loss of the most important ones . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) and Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures minimum data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing to have no protection there . no one ever seems to have thought about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate interference within the data streams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at present , you should look into the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk errors on a low level and highly scalable . it is open source with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for and Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS , and is also available for and Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebooks , and 46 % of job systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage than e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . meaning that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system to replace disks or the size change of hard drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hit you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or the like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above , there is a common reason for a loss of data despite backup . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , you can save that one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the full backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental Backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . this creates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save important pictures directly after saving them on your computer , on a DVD or other optical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and evaluate anew over time . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this question should be answered with the explanation in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this is actually always increasing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new record : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; # functions with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ NG is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ NG is designed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required for use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available , and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP can be used for storing the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible Online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI are part of the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups ; standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as the images are on the camera service , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your blank archive , this feature is not yet implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use external programs for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing . if you edit the pictures with &amp; panel ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . export them in web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edit ; in section Add a photo to an album you can add a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera , connect it to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some cameras it may take a while . some cameras do not display preview images on the camera . some cameras do not display thumbnails for each file , photos , films , music , etc. on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page trim properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog displays file properties and photo information , which is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . downloading the photos from your camera into a single album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . download the selected button as long as you have selected some photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing albums is displayed as usual folder . the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums , then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at one time by selecting the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore check carefully if the photos have been successfully downloaded ; you should carefully check if the photos are completely deleted ; you should check this over the camera menu because this is much faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file names are usually re@@ used once the photos have been deleted from the camera , so it may be useful to include the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data based sub @-@ albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix Photo - % Y % H : % M : % M . for further adap@@ tations , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new file name , the &amp; panel ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; gt ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available then it can be used to create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are stored in the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is usually turned off , and in this case will save &amp; digi@@ tise ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog and k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the picture selection is done , &amp; digi@@ cam asks you where the images are to be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in longit@@ ude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS or the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ gra@@ ze an area by automatic recording of GPS data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another person who can locate the place of the photo , it is good to save the location data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographic mapping ( manual ) and finally about manual input of familiar locations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the degrees of longit@@ ude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over its working processes . to access these settings , you need to select settings in the Settings menu . you can choose between these changes by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing can be set , so you specify the default behavior of &amp; panel ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected from the camera interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like e.g. employed photographer , freelance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be the author , if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP@@ TC actions are used to store the data in the relevant IP@@ TC field . this will enable the metadata to be permanently included in the image and not only in the data base ; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without being lost .
images saved as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this enables your cap@@ tions to be read from other image viewers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor is on the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; panel appeared , you can add and edit the file extensions of this list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button update right from each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Chro@@ ma sub @-@ sampling , the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
using P@@ NG compression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and packing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can place the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works loss @-@ free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier versions of &amp; panel , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default is the highlights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned down because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed white in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate like green and red . &amp; gt ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; panel . to keep the time for the demo icing you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ invo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour break@@ age .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction because it is performed during the raw conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ graph ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other can be translated so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module , starting with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures are color management , not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some , e.g. Canon , which does not contain any color tone mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to do the mapping itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of Profile which you can em@@ ulate on how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscape , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; node ; image viewer and image processing supported . by providing this interface it can &amp; digi@@ tise ; many modules that were written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will appear as new entries in the main window menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the menu under Settings , short commands can be set for tasks performed by modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob controls the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic recognition , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the port settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path here / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ boards , you can set the conversation between &amp; panel ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; panel ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button Chan@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can also display &amp; digi@@ tise the ad of the welcome screen , which speeds up &amp; digi@@ tise under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; panel ; . if something has been deleted from the Base Fol@@ der , it will prompt you to delete it from the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different color schemes can be edited ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization , you will find more information about this tutorial in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a quick image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos , and to edit and improve . editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; panel ; so you may not be part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar on top of the top , including tool@@ bars for quick access to the most commonly required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing features change your photos . none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it , so you can save it with file saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button &quot; Rest@@ ore image processing &quot; in tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by changing or restoring the Edit menu by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the restore or restore button in tool@@ bar one moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same keyword , drop image , drop image or use the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the guide menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor Automati@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; panel ; change it from the panel . see the section for setting up image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Ex@@ Export Job Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple clicking on the same rider allows the side@@ bar to appear , or disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - Fiel@@ ds to be used by other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or just switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to the Application button there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . but you can also use the metadata in the files . this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency , which follows the scheme in the following table : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a box with the keywords used before in this &amp; panel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many key words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keyword words can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the selected image and not to the entire selection , please read the Key@@ word Filter section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key@@ word Key@@ word Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , date , keyword and search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and click on the selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword search is set to zero words , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place at each start of the program , and it can also be switched between settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the rule range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why have pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . thanks to El@@ le for this job . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ cam , s concrete implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color management workflow , you can achieve that the colors you print or publish on the web will match those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the topic is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your image work@@ flows meet all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you work on a monitor calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other image output is via email or web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and think about color management ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space in the tri@@ angular region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some major color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ R@@ GB is running the circle . when you work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , before attempting any further manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions norm@@ alize , match , automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction automatically try to experiment from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the limit values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot are as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or out@@ washed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method shows very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or destroys it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the ink range in the red , green and blue channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between the highest and highest values in between . this is only visible when images are washed and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance has been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited , working over a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can execute the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is based on a white balance algorithm , protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it on the white balance sheet of the image processing menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that most pixels are displayed very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Trans@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator increases colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it in a text file and load it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings may be displayed as your original . if you save them your original picture will be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool will open the same dialog as for editing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter of color management .
another important tool is to find tone value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels at the same time and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is useful when your camera or scanner always needs the same bug . in the manual for the correction you will find more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very powerful way of correc@@ ting exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel has four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er . the coloured and darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors protected by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the Solar@@ isation Eff@@ ect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) , the intensity of applied intensity is 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply it em@@ belli@@ shes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a picture in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of raising it . all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple den@@ si@@ fication / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated , you only need the area of the slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the zone and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller , and make sure the picture changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right @-@ hand side , the original and previ@@ ew@@ ing the image can be seen . previ@@ ew@@ ing is dynamically updated based on the image settings . on the left , the following options are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of output values can be used for example to create a f@@ aded picture as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , then re @-@ adjust the input values for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click to preview the original image for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel and the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modify channel : this selection box lets you specify the channel , which is changed from the module : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a curve section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you &apos;ve created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel &apos;s channel bl@@ ender , image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images , and you can edit it from the menu colors channel @-@ Mixer of the image processing menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window will show you a preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction will allow you to mix these channels . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me . try to reduce the green channel for black and white shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later , and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portrait against the sky . thus , like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at daytime . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; panel ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , enhances the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; panel , add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . the image with a colored line and Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target image which is decorated with the frame will be greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple format@@ ted text into one image at any point . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation and color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help panel ; apply tool sten@@ cil , you can place a template on a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image templates menu apply in image processing , can be used to place templates over a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must however take the P@@ NG file format and need to add a maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; panel ; mailing list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button Base Fol@@ der in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the shrink files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view mirror appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the Pre@@ view , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this knob shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move : use this button to move the image placed under the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use OK when you want to apply the template to your image , then the image will be adapted automatically for preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing , each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to look shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens a little psycho@@ sis . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process paints a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colors are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in J@@ PEG images , a camera has been used to use internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sc@@ anners apply a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should be careful with this , since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft marks and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview help to edit the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the intermediate image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum rate of R@@ GB and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are avoided and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected , proprietary filtering filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing achieves mostly better results than blur@@ ring . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is most often caused by a previously executed imp@@ ec@@ tivity filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value unlike zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , blur@@ red masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even under optimal conditions , there can never be the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter , it is always possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this image has been made with an analog camera , the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the slider smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pu@@ pi@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ink tin@@ ted allows a customized color for the pu@@ pi@@ l . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration , and the available pres@@ ets are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ der smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 &#91; 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ate to the direction of direction .
direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ s evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD mur@@ m@@ ur will be best removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smooth@@ en &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set . the higher this value is set . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angular distance &#91; 5 : 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small you should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integral step length &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step length in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the highest quality you get by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the running time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected to a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correc@@ ting errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and run a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact created during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses an proprietary algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can smooth the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focus distance . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to notice lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication can occur again .
edge : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response response of the filter . if it is too strong you can not remove all noise or noise tips . set it to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or J@@ PEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or light density to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phase d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) , the noise reduction was applied with default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft marks and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in the un@@ compressed image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and loaded again later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and run a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uniform noise is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ i camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ Sync allows hot@@ tracking of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels , which are highlighted in the picture preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will notice the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
ku@@ b@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ Sync correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; gt ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wide and large photo format , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not uni@@ fy the entire sensor area . instead , sh@@ aded the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the big exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or grey scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which equ@@ ates to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or randomly , to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the lumin@@ ance of the pixels . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; panel ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a fixed thickness and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ heri@@ cal lenses on photos , using an proprietary algorithm by David Ho@@ dson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions , distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but flat@@ ter at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter has the opposite character of the General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size , thus creating a correction of the first degree . negative values enlarge while positive the image shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . best perform this correction than all the first . if you re@@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ nen@@ ess correction the effect would seem obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the image processing or the Zoom slider of this dialog using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next logical step for some motives like shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared movie from the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Ad@@ ding film gran@@ ul@@ tation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the Spitz@@ lich@@ ens .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter film is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film@@ making effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel , oil painting , produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance , like an oil painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , differenti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined part is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphas@@ ised . the lines which outline the outline in drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . these would be good pictures to start with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controllers with one value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size , and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey mon@@ strous landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depth allows adjusting the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wavel@@ ength 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave Block 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time , using the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zoom Un@@ bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels into the center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ focus : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent Un@@ bl@@ ur : find the pool in the image and catch it , without changing the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photograph into rectangular cells , and then re@@ generates it by filling with an average pixel value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose with the &amp; panel ; image processing hold a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or turning to correct orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big question is , how can you zoom a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom out or guess the details ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form Size to change in menu and enter the target values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool for size change uses a linear interaction method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set . the higher this value is set . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each insertion for photo can be stored as text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking photos is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long and long CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . previ@@ ew@@ ing ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation to comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the right button and raising the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ cked by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width is assigned to the width of the width . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons have to be centered horizontally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog below , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the editing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF charts , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the translation help make it possible to show help , so that you can put together your images better . these aids are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ organ harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic triangle on the diag@@ on@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Mitte : the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to create your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden pitch in all times to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 and etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre provides more liquid aid lines , when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third level the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this kind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to guide the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the colour of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free press is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . you can set the slider to 0 degrees with the Pre@@ ferences button . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
for your help the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cut out of image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally Tri@@ mming function . choose one of the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angles to the left : shows the current angle in degrees , at the lower left corner of the transformed area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean it is to crop the image with converting cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locking tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and shift the other part to the opposite . this is not rotation ; the image is distorted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation ; the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Trans@@ form Sc@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can pair horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the preview window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single sc@@ aling this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two lubrication produces twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after proofing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to crop the image with converting cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the image processing list , you can change this list of file extensions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . thus , redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than J@@ PEG with the same compression ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to learn more about the raw image format you can read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can download raw format images in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . &amp; digi@@ tization ; this clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ kam ; does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; preview ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start playback program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go forward to the previously visited album in chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward , if you went back before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you swap steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to edit are in &amp; panel ; included . your description will follow here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the suburbs . these modes are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left pane shows the original , and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper area shows the original , and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left pane shows the original , and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper section shows the original , and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &apos; Style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you wish to view . previ@@ ew@@ ing the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page bar features the essential information on the selected image , and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press it in or out and move it while you press the left mouse button . push it while you press the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for P@@ acking Files . the application can be used for editing coloured pallets , selecting and nam@@ ing colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ allets files that can be installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area , next to a color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box En@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether over@@ writing is selected . select this mode by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a color name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colors in the palette , and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then find it in the colour selection on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ gra@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; graphs are used for viewing &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; graphs are used in science and in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise graph@@ ene . the programs that contain &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are based on View of the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs ; graphical and graphical programs ; graphs with all possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration into &amp; Book ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( making a change in the graph in &amp; out ; converts the graph , and in &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu to open the graph in &amp; out ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally , in a plac@@ e- ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loading large graph ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not , and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of graphs requires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . in this case , the main window will only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list of open files . click the first icon to open the dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether the graph will be relo@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . you can also note your decision , so you can change your choice later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer , you can choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; - instance , or to present the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start the program , you can open all of the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages , and the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to one page , will be inserted on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in from the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page preview with a graph divided on several pages , without head line and with another font &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Rec@@ ru@@ itment gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opening side gives the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for that case ( open the graph in a new window or in a window of the current session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the seating management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) , or decide to be prompted every time you start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears with one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can choose from different &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z , layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ enced graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model , using the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is equivalent to stati@@ stic multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spring@@ loaded spring model for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the fru@@ stration Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a lat@@ tice trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm al@@ loc@@ ates the no@@ des in a circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can add &amp; eg ; modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if needed . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program which uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; it needs the following program packages : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the main tool@@ bar , the status bar , the wide range of colors and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog box appears where you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or if you would like to start from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; returns the last step back . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module , which includes images , provides tools to read and save new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you scan the images from the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by adding the default values duc@@ r@@ he to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click on the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after pressing the scan button , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create screen photos after selecting &quot; Import &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &gt; Screen Photo ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the complete desktop , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all its own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to read other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the screen shot is made , the dialog Options dialog appears with the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Flickr is an online photo management on the internet . Flickr is possible to show photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos online and show your photos to your friends and family around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ex@@ ports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be run through the process of generating a token . so it will be your ID to Flickr . a browser will be started so you can login to Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after successful registration , the module can send pictures to Flickr website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module ex@@ porting to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions that the module provides . for up@@ loading , you need write per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button you can start up@@ loading the photos to Flickr server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the words field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords , during high loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie Options , you can set the per@@ missions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the Change box option before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images , the size is modified in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ heri@@ cal coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and width are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera speed must be converted with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera capacity . if the deviation below is merged , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have no track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog changes the coordinates from a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the location can also be found and set with the shown map . select the region and zoom it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between cards mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you do not need to select these albums . in the range below you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image one page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer ; &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you want to write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ exports that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumbnails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool , to view pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting , one image will be shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows to store images in J@@ PEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses in quality and metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information occurs . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Metad@@ ata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you wish to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the import function of metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program , and then call the Import function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this function does not work with all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . J@@ PEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG code@@ c module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file to MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow .
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show , then you can start using Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the pictures or the content of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to return the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the picture will be displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . in doubt , you should specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you will be able to start the creation of the movie . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with Gim@@ p &apos;s image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W into one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : don &apos;t expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . J@@ PEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them , you should not choose the J@@ PEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the J@@ PEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt . progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to convert all images to an album , using the convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions , the aspect ratio is changed with this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you select . you can add more pictures using the button Add images . for the recently selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw pictures to the image list , and drop it there to add the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button images , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting all images , you can open the OK button of your E @-@ Mail Client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
make sure not to send too many images at once . most email accounts have restrictions for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images , their configuration is stored and used again until you change them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and added to the mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . otherwise , we recommend using the J@@ PEG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose J@@ PEG image file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , then the original details will be added to the images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file name option will show that the file name of the pictures will be displayed in the lower left corner , while the presentation is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a continuous loop , you can then manually ort it with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option to select images by chance ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used the order of images in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1500 milli@@ seconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are over a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub @-@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work@@ top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with comments , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . how you can see through a comparison with the picture are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have input your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current preview images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the mouse to the record , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select another person , only the images on which both persons are displayed are displayed . this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumbnail images to view the images of your range of effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can store your own preview image for each person , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to view images next to the names select the button which is located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can use symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , you will need to select the image for each person . in the View window , you will have to select the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can select the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the Search dialog in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . the date can either be a part of the total file , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can search all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the homepage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Photo Album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time line . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the time bar can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date the first image of this date is displayed in the preview list ) and the time line will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you browse the preview view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select an area of the time line by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are group@@ ed into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you will see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you set . so , you can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this settings area , you place the various folders and the URL , where your website is saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages will be created . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you must copy them manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings that are just described have all three on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set in the output folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to add an HTML page to view the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external files . you can see if the images are stored in the file , or if the file is only a link to images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can view over the File Export menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to copy Man@@ ually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Automati@@ cally Text option to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the pictures have been compressed with J@@ PEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the export file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might want to limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Format menu ... select , become &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category refers to your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories are to be imported into your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the data to be imported to the categories of your current database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been launched as a program for managing your images , but it has been extended and today it will take care of your videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS where they want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and used automatically for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window where you can change the settings of a photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the Options dialog . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ate as explained in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left window of the window , you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however most modules have one help page which you can access via the module itself .
because the modules of several applications are shared among each other it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . that &apos;s why you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I did not warn you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference between and photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . also if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this simul@@ ates and photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , is all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the current album , we have to give the modules a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will be the category you specified in preferences as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , so do whether you have selected persons to view and share it with the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . for example on all images Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case you can set three lists with a text box by defining characters , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be displayed , so that the names used are moved up to find and assign individuals faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the Sor@@ ting icon on the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected remarks for each image separately , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all these images and add the menu item Multiple items at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ haul . to show you that it is an over@@ haul , a special symbol is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , you can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also place an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , and move it outside the window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted the window &apos;s look to suit your needs , click on the Options button ... which allows you to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . see this process in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures from the preview window . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , and either select the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere else without you on the hard drive . in the picture you have to view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images on which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . this is for example shown in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however the preview images are available for pictures 5 @-@ 9 . you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy and paste files from the folders again . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Edit menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , then filter the images that you may see for others and click Up@@ on the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the item entry images , thereby removing all the images you have locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered for blocking the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . firstly , all images on the hard drive and the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can see you in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the info@@ box is on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop it to the viewer . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is available at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by jumping the buttons up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if several images are loaded in the viewer you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out a rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key key , sets the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , are in and out with the plus and negative key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to insert this name . you will perhaps prefer to highlight only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this picture you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you have made features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you choose , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in der preview view , you can add features to the images by simply squee@@ zing the characters for the characteristic after the image was selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be able to paint on the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to select the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; do not fully control it , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ model views are displayed yellow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the symbol in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the right position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you typ@@ ed invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is altered , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby alter@@ ing the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the property properties are shown on the left , and the four graphical views on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window system or if you need a different layout , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple windows and just switch between different arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to arrange multiple views above one another , drag the starter in the middle of another view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to get a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter onto the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left pointing arrow in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can save the current window view with view window system ... save it . a dialog box is displayed , in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have created a scene you can render it render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering ; this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many render modes , from a fast preview up to full @-@ screen images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The render &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar or in menu View R@@ ender Mod@@ i ... select , the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the size map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small part of the picture , select the check box section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this works from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is repeatedly split up and adap@@ tively because the depth of recur@@ sion depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 pixels will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels will be shared in 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately tra@@ cked and the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch on j@@ it@@ tering change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays by a minute amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this property .
on this card you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not made an object .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the scene , select the Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently supported , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet complete control of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can include source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also to insert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on Help in the Property View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder , the first found file will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view , and in the window @-@ type plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model view . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in section R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can change existing windows and create new windows . in the window classi@@ fications , it explains how to create and save window arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drop down sel@@ ector Standard window arrangement : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list contains all existing window orders . a new configuration allows you to add the button Add , and remove a select arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every window arrangement is identified by the name , the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with a card view and floating anchored in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be very popular among beginners : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not insert any sources of light , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have installed everything correctly , take a look at the first Start of &amp; Ki@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , you will notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not change anything about the basic camera &apos;s basic settings , but notice that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the Application button or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a cube ( insert End@@ ress bodies Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; indeed , it offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as floor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then click Apply or En@@ ter button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire model view also shows the level , although at the moment only a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shifting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Dis@@ placement and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can choose how to insert the object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view how the pigment looks now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only a matt black material , because you still have to enter adjustments for the pig@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not see a color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then invo@@ ke the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this item twice ( you can also do this more often but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , select each time mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should be done simply , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the En@@ ter button or the Apply button ) . otherwise the ball would float above the floor , because you have moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , the ball will give a pigment as color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ colored and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots , and click Apply or press En@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness effect and reflection settings already produce good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metallic : not yet selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you can &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the render takes hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the image needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and storage space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version , all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu entry can only be selected , if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeat the recently und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current window order and open a dialog box , in which you can enter a name for a new configuration or over@@ write an existing configuration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option , you can change or add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bend on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying an image file as a color card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images can be displayed either in a separate window , in the size of the image or in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are to always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the right @-@ hand corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three of these , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keys can be specified for each window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set . default is not full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . next starts &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only a few of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the display window displays the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determines if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder , or the image selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider to the right of the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and one window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays great icons for the files in the folder , this display is only possible in the short description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays small icons for the files in the folder , this display is only possible in the short description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shows thumbnails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; also closed , if no more browser window is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
display the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; panel ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; panel ; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos , review corrections and make changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user reports its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer other users of the show@@ photo ; however you may soon be able to answer yourself questions of other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to join the show@@ photo ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developers mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you as much control over its work flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ photo ; change it in the menu Settings sample ; set in 8 pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exposure indicators area , you can select the color shown when the under@@ coat or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . in contrast , the colors with what you are supposed to display should be in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of the &amp; show@@ photo ; has a page strip on the right edge that gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gu@@ inea ; is an application for scanning images , which do not do more than scan and save images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gu@@ inea ; is a simple application for scanning images , which no longer makes images to scan and save images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE projection page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; scanning ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , press OK to open the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ k@@ san@@ e ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a scan scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview knob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the Settings button , the dialog of the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sc@@ anned images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; scanning , you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as a default for the Save dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; gu@@ inea ; -@@ Manual . the button Over begins the K@@ DE Über @-@ Dialog for &amp; scanning ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; scanning .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , and make your keyboard to the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Am@@ aro@@ k has several command @-@ line options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present , and use the k@@ dialogue so that the user knows why a script is not running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; c@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings should be continuously monitored and react to events . of course , a script should ignore the events if it has no use for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script itself needs to be taken care of . if a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now query more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , metadata or the length of the piece ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu you can use D@@ CO@@ P Am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; it ends or when the user stops a script sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Am@@ aro@@ k script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be packed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar Parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your script package is ready you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ r . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than browse through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Collection Browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you already have a few play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ aro@@ k has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used . this and many other useful features make Am@@ aro@@ k the most advanced audio player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , in the Base Fol@@ der of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources , you need to enter the following to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort through the setup dialog , the setup dialog has several cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mood bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ l@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design : this feature is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ l@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ oods files stored in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; provided with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ win@@ / ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser is required by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , when a browser is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save play@@ lists when saving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit jQuery Am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the playlist when moving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep the current piece visible when changing the play , so that the play@@ lists window is up / down to keep the running track always visible in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing the context browser , automatically switch the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the appearance &amp; amp ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of custom color schemes , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the selected color cho@@ oser for foreground and background color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , continue playing automatically with the piece at the place that it stopped at the last exit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the on @-@ screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas will open the color selection dialog . if you don &apos;t activate colors , the default &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box , and some drivers still activate other settings in this card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Collection Card Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , both the selected and their sub @-@ folders to browse music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitoring Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , adding all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device is used for setting up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; on calcul@@ ator : if the machine is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name for which the connection is established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use username : and password : to enter the data , you need to connect to the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the load chart last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
query similar performers : after activating this setting &amp; amp ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . they have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs ; because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org , for example . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b Library for days . you can find the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , Tag@@ li@@ b will become abnormal when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure all of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this will lead to crash when editing the met@@ a information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least not use a value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the email will automatically open when a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but don &apos;t label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : aqu@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ s@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the correct version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are several ways . most of the installation problems are the easiest through the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ n@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please only wear a bug there , if there is something wrong with the correction of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , appears only a blank playlist . how do music pieces get in there now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the interface intuitive , the start window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to review pieces the review column needs to be shown in the playlist . click on the column list of the playlist and select column view rating . you can also select the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Un@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably you lack the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it on the menu bar under Extras equ@@ ali@@ zer .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : what kind of media supports G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include any MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must be used in a bl@@ ender . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to give another sink ( e.g. os@@ sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the sound buffer size ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x can cause problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( exit Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album from the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : D@@ CO@@ P Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command lets you start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can I get the current title in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , if one is on another computer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa your@@ nam@@ username Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k window , and click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click a piece in the click sequence to queue . by pressing the En@@ ter button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k the collection database cannot be created and a lot of error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use Am@@ aro@@ k MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a file browser with multiple folders will pop up and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , you can use mp3 or o@@ gg files instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter ) cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can write the review for one piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then , select the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the item and press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the specified schedule of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in general settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bar , and take the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . install this under Am@@ aro@@ k ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus also caused a lot of bug reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ litter . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same is true for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CA@@ L * * : factory for &apos;@@ Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get the present to handle the file &apos;s no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time has to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then start Am@@ aro@@ k again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Am@@ aro@@ k ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up Am@@ aro@@ k ... audio output type the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . you can naturally take this problem yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed supervis@@ or for arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the tutorial wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . if you would like to upgrade your collection , then this Quick Start Guide should help you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / , and is not compatible with all available drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button , and follow the burning menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages that work with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k are listed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the navigation pane , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you can find the playlist itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped away . the information presented here has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running track , as well as the artist and the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . the title is the name of the piece and the artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database , so no running text script is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Search button opens a search for goo@@ gle@@ .com , according to the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; will change your collection automatically as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a search filter right below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . of course you can also select your entire collection , which enables the filter to be switched off practically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for entries which contain spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head@@ line is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yp@@ ad mapping below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will start k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . with this you can set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the system administrator password when starting the wizard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first time . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use either the D@@ CO@@ P command line program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task are more important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the D@@ CO@@ P command line . to use S &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; basically two other parts described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CDs , format@@ ting DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compression ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats , such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which enco@@ der / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said before using &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily use for read out a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find more information on how to use this program as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start the C@@ DD@@ B request of CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be established first . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ der settings tab in the setup directory , the encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der as the default . it is to be noted that formerly the enco@@ der has been configured in the tab settings in the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the setup dialog for the type of messages ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ts ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the Main Direc@@ tion dialog by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator , with different card cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting up the enco@@ ders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; cut@@ ters &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ GG likes to have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ b@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people , and most of the music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps V@@ BR compression ratio up to 6.@@ 3 . needs up to 320 k@@ b@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ b@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR together stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ b@@ ps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music from youths , portable devices and auto stere@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without considering the file size , then choose this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name and the properties of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with encoding programs , there are often a combination of coding settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example around the &amp; CD ; adding titles to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with lame the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs instead of entering the information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information can be obtained from the artist or the music company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the specified in the system . in this type of configuration it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when invo@@ king the data from the server ( this can only be known to the programmer who checked the code . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally next horizontal mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually made monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; if you want to know more precisely this has always been the best choice for reading Audio CDs ; see also that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution needs to be installed first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
for saving the selected WAV files the enco@@ der and hence the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for advertisement ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of a enco@@ der you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk which is installed on both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be found using a search engine as it is considered not completely free software . anyway it is not necessary to compile the source files you can of course always do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is , and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( lame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps ) . it will determine where the files are stored and which structure is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with every read of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device name is handed over to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available the effective device name can also be given to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is displayed in such a way / entered as shown in the screen shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if you have incomplete information , please let us know if information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : while reading the CD , the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second drop down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is easily changed with the database entry and the directory name / file name / file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b if you download the database before . however , the two boxes need to be selected , at least the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both work equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls code 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the files are stored in a private folder . if the field is not enabled , the files will not be created in the private folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.@@ 3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to release V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the rest , as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you may want to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure that is organized on the hard disk is described in the previous section and set up . first a connection to the Internet is built because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look somewhat different than those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained fre@@ ed@@ b data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try not to find the &amp; CD , this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not happen , look for questions and answers in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best on your &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the Settings dialog ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 step 2 : the CD editor - enter the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input box &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a collection with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments which are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats , see the code help to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD editor &apos;s window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data , which we recorded for the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next row in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all song data of the &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece . only the titles are selected , or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the button selection read out the read@@ out process , then this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the Ri@@ der button to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window to check orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk , the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this error message appears when you are trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in MP3 format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( but two different pieces ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is included in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . resp@@ . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package called k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this you probably already did it ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is aimed at people who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , the following is true for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card versions of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , still am reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after first start of the program , without any indication of how it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stran@@ gely enough if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM , and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and cast ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the playback button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu piece or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after another . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; playing a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and change the playback speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can choose which events should be presented and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song , so you will have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of text events or rec@@ esses from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI Files , which you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section is how you can use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find these from the collection menu under the item Organ@@ ize .... Ac@@ crete there to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired quota in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , you must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button adding a song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the automatic addition to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they have been added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order from the menu , the order is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , select the next song , the next song from the menu item , or press the arrow on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump back a song , select the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu item , or press the arrow to the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when you exit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet if you originally wanted to play a piano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary settings for playing a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional keyboard ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section shows how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard , which looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument requires to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( The drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here the name drum patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key@@ map section is used to specify , how to see sounds on a particular channel or instrument . use is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and instrument , and you only need to use different names in the first line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ maps are used primarily to reproduce sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see , for example , the provided Key@@ maps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to replic@@ ate some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
n is the channel that is displayed on the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option the Key@@ map must of course be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option all events will be ignored which will change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will always be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is to be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n ( r / 40@@ 96 ) it will be used . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends to play a key@@ boards with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . in the Settings menu , select MIDI Settings from the Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are being played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tempo LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . this lets you perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to play the same notes in a very different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and a good synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before setting , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , you can double click on the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; window open in a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or stop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or stop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window and drag the desired file to the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ - and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Má@@ laga .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for extending &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with me , as I might already have the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have &amp; Sch@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and paid no one for it . I want to stress that I only want to get feedback from users , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the defect that pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also apply to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , thanks to all these outstanding musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a sound card , you must &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ SE@@ U@@ AL parameter . it works as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for m@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for and k@@ app@@ name , was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an item , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / folder can be changed by editing , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category and select only the XML content of this part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the play@@ lists from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group selected , without using the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and change of &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying for the end @-@ animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; Body ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; content ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; / lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / etc .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured using typing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even embed the special box for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments from K@@ DE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be launched in a console and after error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the launched process is called kn@@ it layer . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output within and K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to always take a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player is the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ H &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) and the correct name will probably contain a dv@@ d in it .
as the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player only X@@ Video is able to use X@@ Video . this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . for this reason the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; source code , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source and source source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are clu@@ es how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after the device is connected and / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions , these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if support for this project or documentation is desired , contact the box should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have any questions or for comp@@ iling and ki@@ cking , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within that a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about Po@@ sters ; and to know its possibilities , the manual on Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; Po@@ sters ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use it is also possible to use a lay@@ ie ( mp@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
wishing here only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master good books e.g. H. Cou@@ ka / P. W D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers ; 3rd Edition can be used in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Docum@@ entation } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quick entry assistant to &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; out , and the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ cur@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coding : this sets the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ x should be known ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; - documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packs for &amp; latex ; for the integration , they must be selected only in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users don &apos;t need to worry now . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions , and further information is given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the inappropriate ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ boot { command } ) from &amp; box , this function automatically creates an empty line ( for example \ \ &apos; end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu setting . setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements , and latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ conscious of the sub@@ conscious element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own &amp; latex , recovery search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file &#91; eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ose File ) &#93; has been created , click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and is next to PDF the standard output types of &amp; tex ; and there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the description search , the elements of the DVI ; file are cli@@ cked to the editor and as soon as clicking on an element in the DVI ; file , the source text is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the DVI ; viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with other .@@ tex files . a project @-@ wide Master document can be set for project settings when using a project .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be transmitted in the tongues of tongues , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be found . the selection fields were developed for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Other can be used for quot@@ ing items such as key words , joint notes or references . the available options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or another element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote a selection list will be displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this will only work if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . the font sizes for the main text , the joints etc. can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cl@@ amps after the command \ \ set class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font is not specified at the beginning , it can also be done in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the button quick construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le , for the storage automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , you should search for the fault . if you are using rapid construction , you should start logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an environment ( eng@@ l. environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 will be created and only a few sets will be created within the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes are monitored only within the environment ( \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ in { environment } ) . there is no limitation ( number ) for changes within an environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many options to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , li@@ pos@@ u@@ aries , c@@ ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for itali@@ c printing and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ &#91; emp@@ h } .
\ \ quote : generates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { exposure } and ends with \ \ &#91; ratio } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le follows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can return to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a / Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Trans@@ formers or computer screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed with file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar allows to convert the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion can begin to start into other formats using the button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default search permits direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI , file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; latex ; files . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Building tools can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to execute the search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre @-@ search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; box ; opened and bound to the corresponding line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should an error occur while using the &amp; DVI viewer ; if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or message window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the log file tells the source code error source . in the editor you can always click the Def@@ ault La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ ext@@ Last La@@ Te@@ X errors for sy@@ ring@@ es between the errors . the log file will always click on the error in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to er@@ ron@@ eous line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear for selecting the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting empty documents , a document may be written from scratch or the assistant can be used to quickly create a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi@@ pp@@ age users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file will be opened or a new file can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document from a template with File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically it is used moment@@ arily : \ \ Docum@@ ents &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , the original template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any kind and latex ; if a simple way to create a template is required , you should search for one on the internet and be carried through the steps described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about it , and to know its possibilities , the manual can be consul@@ ted on Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with the editor &apos;s editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use can be found and their syntax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to choose the &amp; tex ; that means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the opportunity to browse the most different kinds of source texts and to emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries are highlighted in the jump to the next or last jump mark . in doing so , this jump mark is automatically removed during the first input of a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source tex@@ tes added always ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; box ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also shows &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back@@ plot ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the key to remove the whole line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description of Edit , select paragraph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; play . therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to create the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the \ &apos; begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . editing Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing clasp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , then jumped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering various welded group clips , the overview can quickly be lost . this command finally includes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; out , two simple reference marks are used as boxes . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; box ; the character is used for two simple directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic entry of double marks can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le , and La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also be used for specific settings ( e.g. , n@@ ack@@ ers or French ) , so that German or French can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; drop ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a table environment , plug &amp; drop ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an inclusive line break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X may be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few users want to assign columns in tables -@@ environments , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; three different modes have been added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ begin { environment } is &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ in { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to dig out the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be strengthened and the desired parameters can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting the settings box ; setting up , setting up your settings to these lists . you can select different solutions for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as covers for the general language use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a large list of environment commands will have to be entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when invo@@ king complete environment or Alt + Shift key , the setting will automatically fade and \ \ begin . then the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and key by pressing the input key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting the settings box ; setting up , setting up your settings to these lists . this mode uses the black@@ list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by foreign strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word default mode introduced over the editing process or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space key , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character string . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large screens are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been noted that many books are written more than once in a document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the menu box ... fully de@@ cryp@@ ted . here , the threshold value for ad placement can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / mode / ki@@ le / complete / chest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Graphi@@ cs dialog creates graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be followed and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is applied , the pages can be re@@ arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , creating change and creating view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 2 using Alt ; 3 by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the quick build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will appear each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new project is about the project New Project .... here , the following information is asked for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le , allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed on scripts in the vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can be modified in other versions of the API . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; latex ; is a fairly well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different tools to support users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages , and a further &amp; latex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and documents for a graphical surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the largest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click with the mouse , or pressing the space button to open the viewer for the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; node ; &amp; box ; is also a part of the Fink project ; &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be drilled .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with respect to the &amp; GNU ; -@@ license you can use in Men@@ Ã ¼ aided Ã ¶ ter &amp; ki@@ le ; .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; with the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for random signatures , any signature will be selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for day signatures all day the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; in the Sig@@ nature section , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create as many signatures as you wish . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove or click the symbol with the red cross section in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use and cookies , 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your emails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the older the stack entry is , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on an order in the shown list , the cur@@ sor is transferred to the corresponding file number of the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the style sheet is started , the Deb@@ ug@@ gen stage manager can be selected in the Deb@@ ug@@ gle menu . then click on the index tab , as in the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a file name can be an absolute path to a local file , or only the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template or mod@@ us@@ name can be a fully qualified name , whereby the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template is also defined by my@@ template &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first click on the stopping point to be deleted in the list of the current stops , then press the Rem@@ ove button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the status of a specific holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Edit Settings dialog , on the page colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set , disable or delete a stop by using buttons , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the symbols in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is captured and either in the stage manager ... dialog or in the &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window shown . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the various tools are available through the de@@ bu@@ gging menu , with the Insp@@ ection tool most important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on step @-@ by @-@ step guide in the menu , a dialog for choosing the flow speed will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop the procedure , press the W key or select step @-@ by @-@ step guide in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text cur@@ sor in the main window will be added to the corresponding line of this file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use Com@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s stand it a bit , simply click on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finish it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application needs inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is stored in the folder , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the desired folder in the other folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time they are started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book , then simply leave the current work folder . if not , select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then let the current file be checked . if not , select the file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; speci@@ fying the definition UR@@ I ; file selection is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; tool ! this uses the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in its home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; yourself may benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; items can be found below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog allows to manage all of the included plu@@ gins and add new additions . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are intended to be self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member can have several roles within the project , as well as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and clicking the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and notes , see for more information on comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see also for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later can be seen how much someone is working on or sending a message when a file is inserted into the CVS repository as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog can create , edit and delete events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipients list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add comments is easy . either the note entry from the editor context menu , or the keyword keyword in a comment area , followed by comment text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes can be sent to a particular member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) is a role in the project : team leader Sub@@ project manager The respective area or sub@@ project manager should be cited as in the following examples below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... called . this dialog covers some pages , which are treated one after the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion , it can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically entered tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically entered attributes . normal / lower case means , the attributes are inserted in a way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional Tags automatically close : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; update Start and End tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically replacing ac@@ tly characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code , during typ@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here however is e@@ jected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates periodically backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reset window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface changes through changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings , by activating non @-@ demand requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . for different modes see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action caused by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of Struc@@ tural Settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are such ones in which no item has been found in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation is slightly different than in a group for Jav@@ ascript . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug @-@ ins are part applications of third party that can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load the component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is denied the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading , if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry also when the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely newly developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently only one plug @-@ in available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; app@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the button Options next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed , usually appears in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger needs . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be taken care of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ g session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is started , the script starts with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement , and proceed as if there was the current one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find at ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type editing pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers to use simple and productive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without the risk of a typing error .
tag folder is nothing but folder . they contain only the open descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version so available . ( for example html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and decl@@ aring if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail , and everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only element type above itself nothing else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this text is determined by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text &gt; tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog . this is an only element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this element can only appear once for each attribute . additionally , it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the source texts for the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and the attribute tree attribute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a pattern name and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only occur once in a dialog for each attribute ( e.g. once for each and every ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and each ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined , this element is a only element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a list of elements that end a day , this element is a only element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; file &gt; replace . to refrain from doing this will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to check Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear which is simple instructions to follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following is an example of a 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for this . edi@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ stating . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads to the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the User @-@ defined button , button short@@ cuts can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detection settings , and if the action is executed , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ op@@ t.@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; % f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is added ; this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this is used by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can accept input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default entry . possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable usually makes sense only with this setting .
according to the input the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output written on the default output ; error messages are directed to the default error output . it can be indicated what is to be done with the output written to the default output :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window , starts editing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill out all necessary fields , and add the day to the right tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that you can input when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it , before we have difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit . select from the menu ; , Graphi@@ c Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called off , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled to the user that clicking on this icon will insert ; start ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the Apply button and continue using other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be divided into multiple groups to better view the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note , how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absorbing all symbols , ensuring that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most remarkable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ative language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository , if someone has done this for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path . relative to this file for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation for something like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = n@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction = split@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = plain syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are being replaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file he@@ aders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of separate context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local and global use . then create a folder like do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else whom . at different places there is an email sent menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resources can be uploaded into our main archive where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download it . we recommend that the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for our team as well as for later users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message will appear with the information of the resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format could be needed . it &apos;s the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition bar : the string that looks in ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d to appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor to be adjusted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars and actions and patterns in the global tree which will then be available to everyone in a multi@@ user environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that only this user can use them personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ powers the joint use of special tools and patterns from all staff within the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Editor window , the construc@@ tional views , the multip@@ liers with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click the right mouse button to select a context menu with the current document , relo@@ ad , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rect@@ angles in the editing area lead to a further context menu on the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the text under the cur@@ sor or open the file , when the string under the cur@@ sor indicates a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag that represents the tag , click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill different fields in a dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and through . in the presentation with tabs , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can then be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the categories depend on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available to use local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the left mouse button to access the available information to a script . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tree appears under the other dimensions . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded and can be edited and edited by adding a folder do@@ c to a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D currently used in the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of tool@@ bars is the option to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive through &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to change the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . to get a complete list of all options specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; constra@@ ined , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions and scripts and tool@@ bars it is possible to increase productivity without having to remember any scrip@@ t@@ language syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , enter , or use help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converted when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ depreciation so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key , key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; display the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switching and switching the problem re@@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated , as soon as you change to the structural tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the symbol column to the left of the main window , which allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . then , the selected files will be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
searches for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; AB and if you have downloaded other input / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you will find the details explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load a tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local , or project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with tool@@ bar as an attachment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load a &amp; DT@@ D ; , you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present fails the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu provides a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will only work with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the plac@@ ards ; -@@ Version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enables status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of Po@@ sters , you will find details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and modify the sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , because after completing the project name the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be filled in automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , except you process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ uk ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project , and multiple files or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection by credit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook , or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last screen of the new Project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard , and are described in . the additional entries are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional options to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the required de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as viewing a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing their own site view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the window event configuration , you can switch event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously scheduled event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to open another project , choose Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project manager gives free access to the files in the project , where the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are open and open with ... in the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files , see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is f@@ aded to prevent the removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk will not be asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the server &apos;s name , to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your measurement . the password is stored on the disk so it cannot be read , but everyone with knowledge knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there can be many views , i.e. by simply changing the view diverse files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted on the project tool@@ bar project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which you have the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows you to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your own working method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best st@@ acked on the tool bar . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars will be treated at the bottom of the section adding tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be selected using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , which can be inserted into the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bar ... and set Settings actions , set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can copy , move or link any existing folder to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set for the file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions shown at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text including images and PDF ; s . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents can be made from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area over and over again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based . see also for more information on the template tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Save As Tem@@ plate ... As a local template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select Text in your document and click File Save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binary Tem@@ plates are simple : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this purpose , such as drag and drop or insert via the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , set a name for the template and secure . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates enable a very targeted approach . you can present head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or associate dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is enabled by default and dis@@ ables everything except the regular folders in the table summary . if a root folder is set , it would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and allows a whole presentation to be equipped with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers for all templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source code where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol shows the v@@ oh@@ and@@ escence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . there are no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already activated by pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . by selecting V@@ PL ; - View can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time interval can be adjusted automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to edit the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template , pressing the button and selecting the appropriate file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor &apos;s use is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over tool@@ bars like in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag surrounded with text must be removed any other interc@@ eding tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ et Assistant or the Li@@ sts Assistant are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be traced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; still lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present in a typical installation by &amp; k@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without need@@ ing . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder . for example loading a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible the following entry is possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template named QNAP ME or a specified mode name is checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the stated &quot; QNA@@ P@@ name &quot; will be extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sought @-@ after tag has to be terminated for the UR@@ I and line number associated with it . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if --@@ repeat is two times stated , the conversion will be 100 times executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input keys are treated as HTML files , if the support for this has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function converted and k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is useful when two persons work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , also helps you merge and merge complete folder . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check the code , you will like this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a file is equal and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can ease the typing by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
folder 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening dialogue mem@@ ori@@ zes your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the file for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a folder ... if you select a folder , but if you select a folder for B and C , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately define a output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here , you can set options before starting the comparing / merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the C@@ anc@@ el button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop , simply drag file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : at the moment , you can &apos;t plug anything out of it . only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning : some editors interpret pulling and dropping text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data may be lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a difference is detected , one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line separating the text column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with dotted lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a Info row with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find the lowest dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time must be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clicking with the left mouse button in the context column in one of the windows will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of the position in the windows . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind , and may yet again choose another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . when you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , page on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window has been declared ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the selection into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the option sel@@ ections automatically . if this is checked , you will automatically copy the option to the cli@@ p@@ board . if this option is checked , you may accidentally over@@ write the cli@@ p@@ board contents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
time @-@ ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files . therefore you should not use it with binary files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end , and will be restored to the next start . ( setup Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( on some systems the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ ast@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line end type you prefer to save , the default value is the generally accepted selection on the operating system you use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison may look identical . during merging , this option needs to be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; ) are ignored but they are treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details , see documentation for comparison and merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must quit and re@@ boot so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control center . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the selection fields for coding , a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different codes can be compared and merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ si@@ ghted columns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply exit the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can also be useful to view long lines . ( this option is in the window menu , too . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command becomes visible and not the file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . if a regular pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the line is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this command command for line distance to turn input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; converts the found text into capital letters ) .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to create automatically generated string ( info : / c@@ vs / keywords \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another device for line distance suitable . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing so virtually extingu@@ ished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you might want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at once , then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever with per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) you need only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data , after the normal pre@@ processor , are maintained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm sees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you are using a regular pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that alters text or hides differences , you can accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes , without actually performing it ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders does not start automatically . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , you will be notified a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were compared to that date will be listed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and folder that has been found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) , which is possible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the connection action can not be automatically selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen in the picture above , colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with identical entries , however , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered to be identical when their content is identical . then , folder also have the same color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , becomes red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are entered , and when the option directories synchron@@ ize . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merging and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B ; copied and diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is selected , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. When such errors are not removed , merging the folder cannot be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during merging , one file is processed after the other . the Status column shows fer@@ tig when the merge operation was successful , and other messages when something unexpected happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a Complete Analysis file comparison method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , it will be used in the three @-@ folder merge mode as the target , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be listed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect items . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options performing , simul@@ ating and ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen , without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , choose File merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge the problem , you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue to merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section named directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the Ele@@ mental Tree . separate samples can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ contained files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point has been selected as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the Ele@@ mental Tree or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is disabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that this option does not contain any recur@@ sion . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain amount of security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified in this mode . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are stored in both folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , as it will check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the Fol@@ der merge view remains visible to merge single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between folder &amp; text window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . in addition , you can set the current file merge from the merging menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify the files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things , you should note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P starts first and foremost the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 then press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
typically requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then the patch starts and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view to - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by examining the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or they will go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information on this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editor notes for every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost when the result is simple as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text , suddenly pop@@ s ; No sr@@ c appears ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . for this , use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and lots of people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 base folder ; -@@ Distribution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure check the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . past@@ ing ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt insert ) inserts text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also means that identical files may not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C let@@ tering below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ stated characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
der &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space to change their size or shift them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both inside a desktop or on other working areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the blank background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the context menu has only two entries to set up ... and shut@@ down .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual work@@ space are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connect this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual work@@ space . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be specified : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid is known as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally shows all virtual work@@ space in a horizontal row and is very good for representation on the sides on the desktop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and selecting switch to select ... allows the dialog to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do it manually : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or assign a value to this file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use with &amp; K@@ mag ; you can read a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which constantly extends to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an alternative , you can &amp; K@@ mag ; to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window or the environment of the mouse @-@ display at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can paste the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts or stops updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the refresh rate ( very low , low , medium , high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , relo@@ ading ( using the button Document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and shrink &amp; etc . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and that each mouse click causes pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from pain that is related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , is useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse , wait till the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the mouse to the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when switching on Intelli@@ gent Move , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and select the General tab . there is a slider to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is selected , will &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Application button , the settings will be reset after the last press hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you should be aware of where a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or spots in the browser window does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . however it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the clever move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens whenever you are using a window manager , and move a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you can even carry out a mouse click . hereby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intelligent shift is an advanced function by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy and paste text into the cli@@ p@@ board or use any other action you want to use . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it and use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent move , even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window . this should already be the case on most system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeakers , and this is correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages you can choose frequently used passages without typing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is clearly and contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a flow memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the processor . you can select sets that are to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the word completion and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the voice output field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you can find this command in the documentation of your language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on ; the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardised interface for voice output is available and the currently available in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is meaningful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Menu Text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice of instant speak , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the editor &apos;s memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second drop of the edit window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages should be automatically saved when closing the processing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book will be saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text passages will not be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word completion page contains a list of words for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the list . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , in the course of time , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sections of the editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the processor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu item is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar can be moved by clicking on the smart left side and drag the tool@@ bar to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated when not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by clicking on the smart left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will probably not have entered the command for the speech output correctly , or not completely . open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for language synthesis for more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display an example for the command line for the voice output device , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to de@@ compose the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / Ji@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
_ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in one line , and the option to send the data as default must be enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice output da@@ em@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; node ; -@@ further language service which provides all &amp; node ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use t@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ generate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is no speakers synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; , even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech output is performed via the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows the generation of language output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) through the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a text editor module , with which a text file can be read completely or partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the bu@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts . you can also subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use it , you must install and adjust the program to the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the General card is shown in General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different types of voice , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the card tab speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card will appear automatically when you start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already furnished appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row further down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; actual system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voice type here , three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and female voice are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost using it . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can work on the card order to create and manage text orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and you can edit and read text orders . see . remove the marking and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when t@@ m@@ gr is finished , t@@ t@@ ts will run ; on the other hand , if the field of voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically when reading the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the preview is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , stop and record text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in der &amp; k@@ de , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD click on the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , the Web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to read and select Text from the main menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; out ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text displayed . first check the text that is to read and select Text from the main menu . then the speech output should start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also works when &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system , which you notify about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message if your nick@@ name appears in an I@@ RC channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a &amp; node program supports K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which comes complete with &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are one of the advanced capabilities of t@@ act ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to select mis@@ spoken words or short@@ cuts , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech tape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the resum@@ ed orders will be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you use from the card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses tex@@ tual orders . text jobs are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
string Compos@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . you can select the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string ann@@ ot@@ ations such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or by e @-@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ forms use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in scope of delivery ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have selected a female voice for example on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were installed on the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of normal filters created . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the filter type , and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern to set up character chain action filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced against the corresponding replacement text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you wish , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replacing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to post@@ p@@ one the word marked , or the regular expression in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a language is entered , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click on the button to hold a list of languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; - Num@@ bers need to be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter copies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the string replace filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions correspond to an entry in the box dialog . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you can find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is accessible by the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the dial@@ up filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before &amp; pun@@ ts ; there is a nar@@ r@@ ator for the text . the speaker is selected according to the nar@@ r@@ ator properties that the program sends and sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends and the properties of the speaker configured on the card can be over@@ written by the speaker &apos;s selection filter .
if a value is entered here the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be accessed by clicking on the button to get help in typing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to select the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the language selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to save , load or load your language settings or delete all settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dial@@ up filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if true . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; accessibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface by &amp; k@@ de , from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text of the text for reading and using a language code such as eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are even more commands you can use , for a list of all commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console ; window . first start t@@ d in a window , then t@@ m@@ gr in the other window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; de@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( Male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause error in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing b@@ ash . what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct language . if there are any problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ T@@ TS also works with any synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech synthes@@ izer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ iling and comp@@ iling , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source repository for cro@@ pping or downloading the tar@@ ball that is currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you are using a speech synthes@@ izer , check first whether your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed in such a way , that the setup of ph@@ d @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is divided into single sentences . the user can return sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an application passes text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can request properties of preferred speaker for output . if you have created a speaker whose language is English and its sex is female , it will automatically be the best matching speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the card speaker on the list or click Edit for a speaker on the list or click Edit , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . you will find details about the modules below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you will need to enter only festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , which are known , this setting is applied automatically . in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this gray , the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker yet ( or forget to click Apply ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and doesn &apos;t work , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , together with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of phrases and the currently processed sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order listed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; art is not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only text orders listed and managed . expendi@@ tures of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or dict@@ ated without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ,@@ 8 % approximately twice the normal speech speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the current &amp; short , click Apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system , most of which will not work . you will need to figure out what device will work with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the resum@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning has the next highest priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; pun@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start reading K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select this check box to turn on &amp; Connect . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and / t@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications for which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click on the Add button , a dialog box appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events for which nothing else is specified in the list , will be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; pun@@ ts ; do if an event occurs , you have the following choices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event All al@@ erts for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all Noti@@ fication will be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for voice output control , speech speed , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 8 , % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first set is synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit@@ er filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limits , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn the choice of speakers is to select the speaker selection and select text to read . change the selection of speakers , change some properties and test how the speaker is selected , otherwise the filter will be in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with the preview , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can pause or cancel orders on the card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up when you start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
boundary recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit@@ er filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de , messages , warnings , messages , or output of screen re@@ aders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the normal set limit@@ er filter removed from mistake , you can paste it again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card selection card , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top@@ most one on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker features defined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of an furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , choose &amp; act ; the speaker will select the speaker that best meets the original features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired language properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , give nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box if the property has priority over other properties , and you can also set several markers here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as priority property . you will probably use this property if you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language than that in the working environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all properties in the speaker range , which is best to delete the following , click the standard speaker on the select button and then use on speaker , which is most likely to match the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , 0 means the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is not compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is not compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : to open PC@@ M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on your system there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA may occur which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but dict@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / dic@@ t.@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ve / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work the program must be so@@ x installed and discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card holder unit .
the settings for the language speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is transformed into SS@@ ML ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter and set up the speech speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival or@@ ator , but &amp; pun@@ ts ; reading the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so the x@@ s@@ l file for converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber does not produce any errors . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added a special string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab , the job just consist of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; invo@@ ke the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA in the audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and start a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the speech speed , but otherwise it is not necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you have &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( packed with tar packed archive ) , login as a regular user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following modules for speakers synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs translated from sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your language synthesis works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and multiple voices and voices are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( Male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software at festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ IP / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Linux distri@@ butions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then the festival will take over the lex@@ ical analysis , and the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; the program and the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from voice files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ eme t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , editing the error corrections is not necessary , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; ) &quot; / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ .@@ sc@@ m . add the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; acquire and install at first Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then , download Festival Czech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival Lite is a free speech synthes@@ izer , which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fli@@ te is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Linux distri@@ butions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ lay@@ ered speech synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthesis is good but the support is currently limited to a few languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load at least one German language file from the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , and un@@ zip it in the / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card ordering menu , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ ed speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the epic programs do not exist in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a fre@@ eware synthes@@ izer written in Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , you can neither adjust pitch , volume or voice speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use a command that writes the speech output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; K contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the menu ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware can not be installed . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network features enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network settings module is loaded , when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by selecting the non @-@ again questions setting the setting will be automatically set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . this is divided into three tabs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Ri@@ der Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list , and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start so no further configuration is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the manual selection manual , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , if required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain registration by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls DNS this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be placed in the list with kno@@ bs on or down in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There is the Edit dialog displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the List Nam@@ know@@ ingly well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the List contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ep@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , press button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a named host@@ name from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog acquain@@ tance calcul@@ ator is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command needs to be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it suff@@ ices when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a graphical interface tool can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ 2. the following commands should do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue to spread in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is available or if available , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 25 ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes modified dynamically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if other content is found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the others who have been forgotten , here - you know who they are you @ foo@@ .@@ t@@ ld &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs on a schedule in the background . it &apos;s a graphical interface for the cr@@ on Unix system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already created tasks and associated environment variables . if you use it as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for internal tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the task is de@@ activated , the program name and parameters are not displayed and the description will be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environment variables appearing here set aside the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks , except force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new task , select the task folder first . then go to the Edit Settings menu and click New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N in the Rel@@ ated context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the program to be launched here . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Mon@@ thly ( s ) as well as day of the week ( s ) , the program will be performed on 1 and 15 of the chosen months , regardless of the day of the week , and on every Sunday of the month no matter what date they fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be activated when the c@@ ron@@ tab is saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to remove . then go to editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select tri@@ mming , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and set the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click the variable and select En@@ able using the right mouse button . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific printing dialog options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it provides the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast and selective un@@ packing . the second objective was to answer a question which my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ool the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . notice &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be recre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when everything goes smooth , the tape changes the tape to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before e@@ asing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; speci@@ fying by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be produced by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tape mode needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not necessarily correspond to the format of the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape away . after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you check the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a backup profile in the tree , only the files specified in the profile will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files , and / or sub@@ folders are backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree , and select in the Sich@@ ere menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for the backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the rate of data and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file , or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click in one of the archives , and select the menu item Veri@@ fy .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test procedure has been started , the Settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog box appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want from one of the archives , with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right click a file or folder in one of the archives , and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the restore is started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings , and you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current work folder , where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system will be backed up as the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; s ; he@@ als ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is active , transmitted , and dat ; before the tape is involved the command will load to the drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat is enabled , to lock the e@@ jec@@ tor to the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , dis@@ connect &amp; dat ; automatically e@@ jected to the tape . do not use this option in Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must report the block size for your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( n Byte ) The volume of this string is host@@ name : seconds with the name of the complete name of the system on which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that the band has been format@@ ted in .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the content of a tape . this icon is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , experienced users can quickly access information about problems appearing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features that can filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many other functions are also included , and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - is not shown to you , and it will not be opened with system administrator rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or according to input strings . in the default setting , the list of minutes will only be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the protocol file system log the column process is selected , and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of step hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut off setup dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to display only specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can use the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new rows to be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more current information about the source resources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; in addition , you can find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; - Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; archive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
welcome to &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; System V In@@ it Editor rather than &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the V In@@ it system is fast becoming the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . the kernel looks first at / etc after an in@@ it file . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d D@@ ort , and the following additional folders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot when starting the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial that is only launched once . such calls may include r@@ c.@@ local .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first one that it finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , and you should see a line like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can fix / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and then fix it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument , such as start and stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other hand tool is simple to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move scripts either between the top level , or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ rows of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the number or name of an entry manually , press the button to open the Properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the En@@ ter button to accept the changes or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / c@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine starts af@@ res@@ h . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the LI@@ LO prompt , enter lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Deli@@ x or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without message if your configuration files are not installed or mis@@ configured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some learning flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have extended advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card will appear if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password management card appears , if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d have been installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this card only appears , if there is at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the fil@@ esystem , with a limited space limitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user / group works similarly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , remove , modify , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
