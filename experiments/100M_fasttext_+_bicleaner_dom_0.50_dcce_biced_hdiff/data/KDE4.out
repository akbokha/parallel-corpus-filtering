&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the whole &amp; URL ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations do not make important decisions dependent on the translation before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert texts directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions , please refer to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions ... Open the card tools and select the modules you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a list of default settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note , if you have more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click on Tools menu . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or the list of cr@@ ashes if available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module view filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras In@@ struc@@ tional Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M tree node . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects using the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap shows a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched by color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all or if there is enough space for representation ( whereby display errors can occur by restrictions on the sign of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) .
for placement algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this is not always maintained . note that less space for the frame is lost when the square is square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation , so that rect@@ angles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the module Picture Gallery , a dialog box opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page , in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Pictures per line has a slider and a script , to set the number of images in each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display the file name of the image , specify whether the file names are shown in the pictures in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display the file size of the image , specify whether the file size will be shown in the gallery in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is shown in the pictures in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all &amp; k@@ de , programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; It is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers might help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; gt ; then we would like to encourage you to answer other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage , to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization ; to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to get involved , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for registering in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ cam ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder icon or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; panel ; will you use as an al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as base folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not have photos as symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shell File Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the R@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m , and Ro@@ h workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ s.@@ more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . older cameras may also be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow this connection is dated .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumbnails can be read remotely . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things to &amp; about , is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal separation line or another application window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name will only work if it is shown in the symbol view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all the photos stored by &amp; gt ; these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the appearing menu you will have to select or copy multiple photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album contains a collection of photos and album features . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album features in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to add or delete collections from the collection , you can select this from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Album date : when you sort your albums by date with View albums , sort by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you first select an album in &amp; confirm , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the photo on the album . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections cannot be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album for the first time , you must wait a short while the preview images can be generated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview window . which information these are , you can change the settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thumbnail displays the most important features , including all the tags of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo editing displays your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with right mouse button and editing ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; gt ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and the program from the sub@@ menu of opening with the right mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some programs do not store this information when you save the modified image , so that information from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data is lost , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way is to click the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can right click the preview and select F@@ 2 names from the context menu . note that the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc . ) will be retained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; panel ; delete it , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Un@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gt ; Use the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in Picture View . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date sheet so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . therefore , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key list quot ; fold , so that you can easily find the words you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My key phrase , or click on an existing keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the keyword of this keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired location in the tree and disc@@ ard it there . then , a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the keyword menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word quot ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the album menu in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the pictures you have selected with a keyword , you can also click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My key quote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can display a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the right @-@ click context menu of the photo , and select Del@@ ete from the Menu Menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the box frame which displays the time unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if you find nothing found , then the lamp will be red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will find a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search that will always filter what you entered as a search criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the text box Save as will be used to select a name in my search list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Search Edit , the search function will appear with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit As advanced search , more rules for searching will appear . see the Advanced search tool section for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; panel ; s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are shown with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar posts : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ tise ; find the appropriate pictures . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel or press it and move it while you press the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; provides a light table in a separate window that lets you easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw data , together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The illuminated table is added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the preview bar , you can draw the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to quickly retrieve from a series of images . if you use pair wis@@ s from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the normal delete actions work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all picture information from the main window of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to view the visible area of the picture , you need to hold them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom knob below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and the permanent storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , edit , group , archive , archive , archive , search , and export picture files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management records , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , and exports content that holds a monetary or cultural value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data via data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that can be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not even need to find a particular photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use a very fast search and secure archiving which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . you must decide if other access to your photos should have been organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will need to switch to a bigger drive sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holiday pictures can be easily found in one year at the same location . if you make enough photos , then you will need sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the file &apos;s settings page . if you forget this , you can subsequently save metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do this , &amp; gt ; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the actual work starts , as you should select keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically build the tree for you or simply paste the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; panel ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I &apos;m telling you this of the landing place of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream to have associations . you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember the key is it the importance to be@@ holder to help him over the motive that she has moved has to understand what you understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; Fix ; you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as labelling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . you can even export your pictures in web galleries .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another town without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is now with speed of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a copyright with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tili@@ sed , as information should be deposited : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples for this can be title as : employee photographer ; freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field it must be filled in as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the advertising field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations can be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image , and it will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : plate defects , plate failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread Aber@@ deen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs lost on the street or brand . these types of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this solid protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it works under Windows and Linux , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disc@@ othe@@ ques retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy study
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed Mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . but remember that not every connector strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . some manufacturers provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keep in mind the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . you can use this as a backup destination for your software with the correct configuration . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering with which you can store any amounts of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important ones . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) and Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your ima@@ gery in full resolution online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS file system and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures minimum data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk errors on a lower level and highly scalable . it is open source with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for and Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system , which is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for and Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebooks , and 46 % of job systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage than e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 stops from fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from that limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36 mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hit you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into your neighbour house , into your office or the like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , there is a common reason for data loss despite backup . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , you can save that one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the full backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts you can only copy the difference between files that have actually changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back up important pictures , after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards , which are supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this means , in fact , always increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with plans and put the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; # functions with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ NG is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty free and open raw image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive your image , mostly in the raw format , because it stores metadata separately from the image file . so you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI are part of the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert raw data to D@@ NG , and save it in your blank archive . this function is not yet implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; panel ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . then export them in web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; in section Add a photo to an album you can add a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard disk . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera , connect it to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some cameras it may take a while . some cameras do not display preview images on the camera . some cameras do not display thumbnails for each file , photos , films , music , etc. on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page trim properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from your camera into a single album ; and we advise you to check if the photos are securely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only choose the one you want from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . download the selected button as long as you have selected some photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded until now ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in the preview window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums , and select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at one time by selecting the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that there is no way to reset photos that you have deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted ; if you want to completely delete the camera , you should check this over the camera menu because this is much faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file names are usually re@@ used once the photos have been deleted from the camera , so it may be useful to include the date and time the image has been taken into the file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data based sub @-@ albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer open three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the section Standard Car Identi@@ ty . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix Photo % Y@@ - % H : % M : % M : % M : % M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in capital letters , if you prefer this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new file name , the &amp; panel ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available so you can automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are stored in the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case will save &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the image selection is completed , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in longit@@ ude and l@@ ati@@ tude and indicated on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ gra@@ pher an area by automatic recording of GPS data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with one click , indicating the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . the question is actually more than the data in these fields . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the degrees of longit@@ ude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script working with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing , so you specify the default behavior of &amp; panel ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected from the camera interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like e.g. employed photographer , freelance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP@@ TC actions store the data into the relevant IP@@ TC field . this will enable the metadata to be kept permanently in the image and not only in the data base ; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without being lost .
images saved as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this enables your cap@@ tions to be read from other image viewers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is on the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; panel occurred , you can add and edit the file extension of this list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button update right from each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . in the image processing , this View mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Chro@@ ma sub @-@ sampling , it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
using P@@ NG compression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and un@@ packing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can de@@ comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier versions of &amp; panel , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default it is the highlights so the parts of your images are burned down because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed @-@ up white in the settings . the setting colors resolve some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various ro@@ set@@ tes . finally you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to construct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate like green and red . &amp; gt ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; panel . to keep the time for the demo cycle small you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reconstruction .
&amp; gt ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like it was used . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction because you are carried out during the raw conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ code ; information such as color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module , starting with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures are color managed , not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile which you can em@@ ulate with which you can em@@ ulate picture from a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target : F for precise style , L for landscape , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing supported . by providing this interface it can &amp; gt ; many modules that were written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will appear as new entries in the main window menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the menu under Settings , short commands can be set for tasks performed by modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sli@@ deshow settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob controls the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic recognition , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path to / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera , you must connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu camera of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation between &amp; confirm ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported and applied , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also disable &amp; confirm the display of the welcome screen ; when starting , this will speed up &amp; confirm the starting process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; searching for new photos forces the start to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time for new or deleted albums / photos ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , it will prompt you to delete it from the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different color schemes can be edited ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve . editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of the ad@@ vert / edit entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them are not part of your distribution , so you may not be part of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar on top of the top , including tool@@ bar for quick access to the most required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save or Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you should possibly customize a copy of your image before changing it , so you can save it with file saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File Rest@@ ore menu . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored . the last action can be reversed by modi@@ fying or restoring the Edit menu by selecting re @-@ creating from the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the restore or restore button in tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be reversed or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same Album or keyword , down the image , down the image or use the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally you can change this in the settings dialog . you can see this in the settings dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences . whole picture templates can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export job assist . if you follow the wizard you only need to make your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation file , also in image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear , or disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - Fiel@@ ds to be used by other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or just switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . but you can also read the metadata in the files . this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Re@@ gency , which follows the scheme in the table below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; panel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keyword words can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword , keyword keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key@@ word Key@@ word Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and click on the selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no key words , which has been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place at each startup of the program , and it can also be switched between settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and created , and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search across all database elements with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why have pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , s concrete implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that are photographed from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colours you print or publish on the web will match those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the topic is based on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs for the results he wants . in addition , you should make sure that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your image work@@ flows meet all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you work on a monitor calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other image expenses are by email or web , where s@@ R@@ GB is de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life so easy , why should one use a different color space and think about color management ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space in the tri@@ angular region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger clear@@ ances , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor as s@@ R@@ GB concludes that your monitor is cal@@ libr@@ ated on s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , before you try a manual manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions norm@@ alize , match , automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction automatically try to experiment from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the limit values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or out@@ washed .
compensate : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image and sometimes it only produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or destroys it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the ink range in the red , green and blue channels . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
contrast aug@@ mented : this method improves contrast and brightness of the R@@ GB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in between the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; panel came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can execute the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correction will be better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it on the menu entry colours white balance of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images that most pixels will display very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it in a text file and relo@@ ad it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . keep in mind that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them your original picture will be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter of color management .
another important tool is to find tone value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is useful when your camera or scanner always needs the same bug . in the manual for the sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way of correc@@ ting exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel has four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er . the colored dark areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors protected by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ation Eff@@ ect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and this processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity of applied intensity is 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of raising it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ starch / Con@@ tr@@ ast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , an active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller , and take care of how the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . previ@@ ew@@ ing is dynamically updated based on the image settings . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic arrangement is more useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of output values can be used for example to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later relo@@ aded . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click to preview the original image for the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel and the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modify channel : this selection box lets you specify the channel , which is changed from the module : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode produces a wide beam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a curve section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you &apos;ve created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ escence channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel &apos;s channel bl@@ ender , image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images , and you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window will show you a preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction will allow you to mix these channels . this is especially convenient if you use the Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me option . try to reduce the green channel for black and white shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Download buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved later and then relo@@ aded , and the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ escence option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can be easily converted on the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portrait against the sky . thus , like the 00@@ 4 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at daytime . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of a prints and re@@ development in a se@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; In@@ come ; Tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a painting image or not , you can make it look like an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , increasing the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied to the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; panel , add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . the image with a coloured line and Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple format@@ ted text into one image at any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; In@@ come ; Tool template , you can put a template on a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Photo Tem@@ plate menu , used in image editing can be used to place templates on a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must however take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the preview , you &apos;ll find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this knob shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move : use this button to move the image placed under the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use OK when you want to apply the template to your image , then the image will be adapted automatically for preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing , each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it is produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture look shar@@ per . you can use it rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focuss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process paints a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the home user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . however , raw format images must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sc@@ anners apply a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should be careful with this , since the results are not very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experiment with Settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the intermediate image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Dis@@ f@@ aging Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . this is a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing achieves mostly better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in most cases even very strongly from the source pix@@ el@@ s. it causes unwanted results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is most often caused by a previously executed imp@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should allow this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Download buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations that are not visible immediately , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , blur@@ red masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red masks use a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even under optimal conditions , there can never be the effect of blur@@ ring . even under optimal conditions , it is possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this image has been made with an analog camera , the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the slider smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark , in order to create a more natural pu@@ pi@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration , and the available pres@@ ets are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fin@@ er , you can use the Ri@@ der smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detail retention p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a smaller value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should ensure that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary retro@@ actively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD mur@@ m@@ ur will be best removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above omni@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going to run . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angle step length as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , you should also make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the highest quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to skip it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected to a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and run a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact created during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radius controls the window size of 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and allows the image to be blur@@ red .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to notice lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication can occur again .
edges : controls edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong you can not remove all noise or noise tips . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or J@@ PEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved into the file system , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experiment with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft marks and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog indicates the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digital images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the algorithm for the restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
J@@ PEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uniform noise is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ i camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected note ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool Hot@@ pixels enables hot pixel of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw processing photos because many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the dark image to the image to be corrected . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and relo@@ ads it automatically in the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an area to see the corrupt pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
ku@@ b@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. , under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wide angle objective , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tari@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 for the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects are caused by movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the big exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or grey scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter on a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which equ@@ ates to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or randomly offset a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; panel ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a Leu@@ ch@@ strengthened and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ heri@@ cal lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions , distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third grain has a similar round effect , but flat@@ ts at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter has the opposite default character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size , resulting in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correction or cushion correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . best , perform this correction as all the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the editing tool in the Trans@@ form menu or the Zoom slider of this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next logical step for some motives like shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film ( see this URL ) . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the highlights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter film is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; panel occurred ; oil paintings generate the appearance of an oil painting , using a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; gt ; filter oil paintings give your digital photos a nice appearance , like an oil painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controls to influence this effect , the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined part is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; gt ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outline in drawing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size , and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) were used . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; gt ; filter en@@ grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray and Mongo@@ lian landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wavel@@ ength 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 2 : analogue to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zoom Un@@ bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blur@@ red vision : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taking photos from a car or train , camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ üt@@ tel@@ Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image by accidental displacement of the pixels , thereby simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent Un@@ bl@@ ur : find the coloured bas@@ ins in the image and catch them , without changing the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photograph into rectangular cells and then re@@ generates it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can keep image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the range will remain free of rain drops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or turning in the right direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo bubbles are definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo , with a minimal loss of image quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big question is , how can you zoom a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom out or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Trans@@ form Size in menu and enter the target values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool for size change uses a linear interaction method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each photo can be stored as a text file , and can be relo@@ aded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking photos is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long and long CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the right angle and raising the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width is assigned to the width of the width . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ aper and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons have to be centered horizontally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog below , you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the editing tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the translation help make it possible to show help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonious triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third organ harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Mitte : the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre provides more liquid auxiliary lines , if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will give you good results for your photos . compared to the third level , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to guide the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you use gold tri@@ angles to break up your frame you create an effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button color , you can set the colour of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free press is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; panel ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ form free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . you can set the slider to 0 degrees with the Pre@@ ferences button . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function , select one of the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angles to the left : shows the current angle in degrees , at the top left corner of the transformed area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angles to the left : shows the current angle in degrees , at the lower left corner of the transformed area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angle to the right below , indicates the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the transformed area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little s@@ me@@ ared . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with converting cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locking tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation ; the image is distorted . in other words a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Trans@@ form Sc@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two lubrication produces twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sc@@ aling , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with converting cut out of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type like these libraries have been compiled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dependency of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list . you can change this list of file extensions ; accept it . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . in this process , redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than J@@ PEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store loss@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to learn more about the raw image format you can read in English from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can find raw format images in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; panel ; you can read more about the use of modules with &amp; panel .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . this clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ kam ; is not a film editor and therefore does not have built @-@ in options to display or edit movies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go forward to the previously visited album in chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only move forwards , if you have gone before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry of the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual , automatic turning / mirror for the current image with orientation in the EX@@ IF information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sort all pictures in the current album by their name , path , date , file size or their rating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start the comparison of all metadata between the database and all files , not just those in the current view as with this menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please view the camera section for more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you swap the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments using the White Balance Module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; panel , included . your description will follow here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left pane shows the original , and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper section shows the original , and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left pane shows the original , and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper section shows the original and the lower , for comparison , the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &apos; Style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure , the used colors can be adapted in the general settings page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you wish to view from . previ@@ ew@@ ing the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page bar features the essential information on the selected image , and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel or press it and move it while you press the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for P@@ acking Files . the application can be used for editing color pallets , selecting and nam@@ ing colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ acking Files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or search the folder for files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create such a choice , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box En@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the Color button , the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the default mode is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a second color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colors in the palette , and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then find it in the colour selection on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ gra@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; files are free layout programs . graphs are used in science and in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise graph@@ ene . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are based on View of the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs ; graphical &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration in &amp; Po@@ wers ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; out ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu to open the graph in &amp; paste ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , in a Po@@ or ; component &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1,000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of graphs requires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . in this case , the main window will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be relo@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can select the Settings k@@ gra@@ viewer ; setup ... , see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer , you can choose whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; you want to open a new &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; - instance , or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start the program , you can open all of the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both save and later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages will not be filled in the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page preview with a graph divided on several pages , without head line and with another font &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refresh page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for that case ( open the graph in a new window or in a window of the current session ) or determine that every time is requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the seating management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) , or decide to be asked for each startup afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears with one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edge overl@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ hierarch@@ ical graph . it produces representations according to the spring@@ loaded model . in this case , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ sprung model for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ nach @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm al@@ loc@@ ates the no@@ des in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph@@ ene ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if needed . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module , which includes images , provides tools to read and save new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you scan the images from the menu item , a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have pressed the scan button , you must wait until the scan is completed and you can specify the compression and type of the image file . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can create screen photos after selecting in the menu Import &gt; Screen Photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all its own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to read other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long the screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the screen shot is made , the dialog Options dialog appears with the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Flickr is an online photo management on the internet . Flickr is possible to show photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos online and show your photos to your friends and family around the world .
the Ex@@ ports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you are using the module for the first time you will be run through the process of generating a token . so it will be used for your authentication . a browser is started so you can login to Flickr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after successfully logging in , the module can send pictures to Flickr website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Ex@@ Export module is launched to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions that the module shows . you will also be asked if you want to continue using these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button you can start up@@ loading the photos to Flickr server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the words field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords , during high loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options you can set the per@@ missions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the Change option before up@@ loading , the photos before upload are changed in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images , the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ heri@@ cal coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , longit@@ ude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to give a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with the GP@@ X file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera system must be converted with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for GPS time and camera speed . is the deviation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have no trace data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog changes the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the location can also be selected and set with the shown map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture one page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your images . for this , select a folder on which you have write permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thumbnail allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumbnails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after launching , one image will be shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows you to save images in J@@ PEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses in quality and metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact Mail@@ ing@@ List k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the import function of metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then paste the image to which you want to copy the metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this function is not working with all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . J@@ PEG is supported when writing . please look exc@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow .
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you must pick the images packed into MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can start using Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the pictures or the content of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the picture will be displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value produces very sudden image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you will be able to start the creation of the movie . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slide when you return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an indicator appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing Gim@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : don &apos;t expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the output formats and save the conversion result . J@@ PEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information on your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use them you should not choose J@@ PEG format since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the J@@ PEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion using the button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . progress bars show how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to convert all images into an album , using the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change in size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions , the aspect ratio is changed with this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; printing preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , margin size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images you see before . other images can draw on the list of images to be sent and drop there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you select . you can add more pictures using the button Add images . for the recently selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw pictures to the picture list , and drop it there to add the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting all the images , you can open the OK button of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
make sure not to send too many images at once . most email accounts have restrictions for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images , their configuration is stored and then used again until you change them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the Google mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and added to the mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like e.g. TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the J@@ PEG format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose J@@ PEG in image file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , then the original expl@@ orer data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open@@ GL &apos;s Open@@ GL transitions feature very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file name will show that the file name of the pictures is displayed in the lower left corner , while the presentation is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop , then you can manually remove it with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option to select images randomly creates that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not the order of images used in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start the presentation again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the lower left edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with comments , you can browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have input your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press people with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select another person , only the images on which both persons are displayed are displayed . this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumbnail images to view the images of your sphere of influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can store your own preview image for each person , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to view images next to the names select the button which is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , you will need to select the image for each person . in the View window , you will have to select the image for the corresponding person . in the View window you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the picture should be displayed or cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you access the Search dialog in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter a string of characters in the field lab@@ eling or description , you can also enter a date that is searched for ; the date can either be part of the total file , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user hand@@ book for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduction videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of photo@@ album ; try it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time bar can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always show you the current date of the pictures currently displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select an area of the time line by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data . you can ab@@ ort the selection only by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not have any images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so , if you want to display a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this settings area , set the various folders and the URL where your site is saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically added to the next time . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you &apos;ve created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages will be created . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to the destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings that are just described have all three on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set in the output folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to add an HTML page to view the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external files . you can see if the images themselves are stored in the file , and that you can upload all the images in the file , but the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you specified in the creation of the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can view over the File Export menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Man@@ ually option , you must copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Automati@@ cally into the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the pictures have been compressed with J@@ PEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the export file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might want to limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that you person@@ alize category Person@@ s of the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category refers to your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported to the categories of your current database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures depicting this friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying the information about your images , via ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been launched as a program for managing your images . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about images , but often this includes videos with one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS where they want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use them in future starts . if you want to start a different folder with images , you can start using the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see the dialog that is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ate as explained in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I , meaning &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have one help page , which you can access via the module itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the modules of several applications are shared among each other it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . that &apos;s why you should always test new modules with the demo database before using it on your own pictures . don &apos;t say I did not warn you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applications that the modules are using via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference between and photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . also if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , is all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the current album , we also have to give the modules a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; S@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will be the category you have defined in preferences as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you use the category People , so do whether you have selected persons to view and share this with the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , once you have a photo@@ album ; starting with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . for example on all images Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set up three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be moved up to find and assign individuals faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sort by date under the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have any comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all these images and add the menu item Multiple items at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ haul . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , you can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also place an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the paste that form the upper edge of the frame , and you can also make your own window by dra@@ gging it out of the window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted the window &apos;s look to suit your needs , click on the Options button ... which allows you to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a viewer window , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , or select the Rem@@ ove button , or select the Edit Sel@@ ection menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere else without you on the hard drive . in the picture you have to view the view of &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the pictures you need can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however the thumbnails are available for pictures 5 @-@ 9 . for pictures 5 @-@ 9 the preview images are available . you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy and paste files from folders . so far , it does not support you to insert the CD concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , then filter the pictures that you may see for others and click OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in case of your little sister . if you give the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the item entry image , thereby removing all the images you have locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be ke@@ yed to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is under no circumstances very safe . for one , you can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can see you in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the info@@ box is on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . all these options are available in a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by jumping the buttons up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if several images are loaded in the viewer you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the Min@@ us button , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out the zoom button and shows the result of zo@@ oms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key key puts the zo@@ oms so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that are in and out with the plus and negative key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the settings from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks on the current image with the menu item notes from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image . but you may prefer to highlight only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature by clicking the corresponding letters . in this picture you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have identified features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you display categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the characteristic after the image has been selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be able to paint on the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the picture from the context menu . to finish painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understand the documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ model views are displayed yellow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the symbol in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you typ@@ ed invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( e.g. a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can right @-@ click these control points , thereby alter@@ ing the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every object has a level of vision as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left , and the four graphic views on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window system or if you need a different layout , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple windows and just switch between different configurations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anchor a window over or below , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to arrange multiple views above one another , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to get a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing at the left pointing arrow in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can paste additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can save the current window view with View window system ... save it . it displays a dialog , in which you can save the window layout under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have created a scene you can render it render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can use as many render modes from a fast preview up to full @-@ screen image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The render &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender mode ... select , the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but it is a name that lets you know the features of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the size map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in combination panel quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this works from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to l@@ essen the impact of this error . generally , images with this property look better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is repeatedly split up and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam depending on pixels . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels will be split in 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be separately tra@@ cked and the depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn on J@@ it@@ tering it changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not made an object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the Import menu file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet complete control of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can include source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also to insert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the property view click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view , and in the window @-@ type plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in section R@@ ender modes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window classi@@ fications section explains how to create and save window arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard window arrangement , showing all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added to the Add button , and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every window arrangement is identified by the name , the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be very popular among beginners : a ball on one level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not insert any sources of light , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have installed everything correctly , take a look at the first Start of &amp; Ki@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , you notice the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view control points you can change the target point of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the Application button or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert End@@ ress Body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; indeed , it offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name , then click Apply or En@@ ter button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire model view also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the object . in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little extra at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens in which you can choose how to insert the object . the pigment will then change in the property tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view how the pigment looks now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only a matt black material , because you still need to insert the color for the pig@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not see a color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time , select one color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should already be done , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the En@@ ter button or the Application button ) , the ball would float above the floor , because you have moved the floor around one unit down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , the ball will give a pigment as color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ colored and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots , and click Apply or press En@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings already produce good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you can &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by each pixel in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the image needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files typically have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu entry can only be selected , if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new configuration or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts , and default behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option , you can change or add commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without changing any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying an image file as a color card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images can be displayed either in a separate window , in the size of the image or in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n , or the Return key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are to always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three of these , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , buttons can be set for each window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can move on . default is not a full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this point activ@@ ates , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you store the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed which can display the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images , this option is turned on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated as long as it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , change the keys for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shows big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumbnails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; also closed , if no more browser window is opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
show the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; panel ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; panel ; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos , and perform corrections and changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user reports its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer other users of the show@@ photo ; however you may soon answer questions of other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developers mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ photo ; change the settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color shown when the under@@ coat or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . skill wise should be the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ photo ; has a side strip on the right edge that gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gu@@ inea ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images , scanning and storing images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; gu@@ inea ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save images , and save images instantly in a folder with automatically generated name and format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE projection page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; channels ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . ( lib@@ cr@@ san@@ e ) does not treat these options , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview knob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the Settings button , the dialog with the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving will be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channels ; to save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; channels , you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as a default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the Save button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time uploaded when a picture is stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channels ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE Über @-@ Dialog for &amp; channel ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; channels ;

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , and make your keyboard to the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Am@@ aro@@ k has several command @-@ line options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should give feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present , and use the dialogue to tell the user why a script is not running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from c@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; c@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Am@@ aro@@ k and control Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings should be continuously monitored and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . with D@@ CO@@ P functions , the script might ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contain the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu you can use the D@@ CO@@ P Am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) that can optionally be packed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your script package is ready you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than browse through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Collection Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may have a number of play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ aro@@ k has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . plus many other useful features make Am@@ aro@@ k the most advanced audio player . Am@@ aro@@ k is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , in the basic folders of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources , you need to enter the following to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , can be set up without effort through the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mood bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design : this feature is only available if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ oods -@@ files stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / / / / / / / etc / ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external Browser : lets you choose which browser is needed by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , when a browser is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save play@@ lists when saving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; amp ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist when you exit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , use the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ date when changing the piece , so that the play@@ lists window is up / down to keep the piece running in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing the context menu , automatically switch the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust the appearance &amp; amp ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section , you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . press select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of custom color schemes , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , continue playing automatically with the piece at the place that it stopped at the last exit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the On @-@ Screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors are not activated , the default colors are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box , and some drivers still activate additional settings on this card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , both the selected and their sub @-@ folders to browse music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitoring Chan@@ ges : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , adding all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the part Collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used for setting the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; on calcul@@ ator : if the host is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name for which the connection is established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter your username : and password : to enter the data , you need to connect to the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the load chart last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a similar interpreter : after activating this setting &amp; amp ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org , for example . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b Library for days . you can find the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also add the broken file that caused the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , Tag@@ li@@ b will become abnormal when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure all of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b will be compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this will lead to crash when editing the met@@ a data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open when you crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map . then check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the correct version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the installation problems are easily explained by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please only wear a bug there , if there is something wrong with the correction of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist appears . how do you get into music there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the interface intuitive , the start window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to review pieces the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist . click on the column list of the playlist and select column view rating . you can also select the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Un@@ f on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing you . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ audio@@ visual this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it on the menu bar under Extras equ@@ ali@@ zer .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : what kind of media supports G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which doesn &apos;t include mp3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must be used in a bl@@ ender . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to supply another sink ( e.g. os@@ sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the En@@ large of Sound Buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( end Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / requests , please send them to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album from the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and I think the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : D@@ CO@@ P Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command lets &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of music that you &apos;ve stopped before going to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to get the current title in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k , if you are on another computer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa your@@ nam@@ username Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k window ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window , which can be changed in size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the clip order in the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k the collection database cannot be created and a lot of error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use Am@@ aro@@ k MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the rating of a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then , select the review of a piece just as all other attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE pack@@ ets have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the proposed plan of Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new feature in Am@@ aro@@ k , which some users can also find annoying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bar , and take the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . install this under Am@@ aro@@ k ... appearance context browser design , click New Design Inst@@ all .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ quer@@ ors navigation pane allows you to monitor &amp; control &amp; amp ; while you browse in Con@@ quer@@ or . start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . click the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add Am@@ aro@@ k in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio sc@@ assem@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus also caused a lot of error reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ litter . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I have &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CA@@ L * * : factory for &apos;@@ Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get the present to handle the file &apos;s no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time has to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator . then start Am@@ aro@@ k again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Am@@ aro@@ k ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up Am@@ aro@@ k ... audio output specify the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . you can naturally take this problem yourself ! if you would like , you can get the new so much needed supervis@@ or for arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for example to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; for example to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k is started you &apos;ll find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and paste the music from there to the playlist , and drop it into the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping them . in this case , dropped files will be inserted at the end of the list and not on the mouse position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply entering the text box . as soon as you enter the letters , you will only press the text box until the text field is empty again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all the entries one , two and three . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then include the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some search for pieces that do not contain something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher score than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and trim black edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this is crossed , a small bar appears at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the contents will be displayed in the content view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head bar is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog window to change the keys for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . with this you can set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the system administrator password when starting the wizard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first time . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use either the D@@ CO@@ P command line program , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are essentially identical in the range of functions , therefore your taste and the type of your task will be decisive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program . to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then you enter something like the following on the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

as a result such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the new project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b ) K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script generates a data project , multiple folders , and then add files to the new folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that encoding these wa@@ v files ( compression ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats , such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said before using &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . in any case you can avoid the use of copy protected audio CD ; s !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily use for read out a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , with everything manually captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , you can find more information on how to use this program as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ DD@@ B request of CD @-@ data will start on request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must be established first . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the Code tab in the Direc@@ tories tab , the coding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ der , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der as the default . it is to be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the tab setting in the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for coding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the setup dialog for the type of messages ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ts ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the Main Direc@@ tion dialog by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator , with different card cards ( like enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ ders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; gre@@ ts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ b@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + High to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps V@@ BR compression rate up to 6.@@ 3 . needs up to 320 k@@ b@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ b@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ b@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music from youths , portable devices and car stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name and the properties of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example around the &amp; CD ; adding titles to the keywords ( English : day ) the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs instead of entering the information . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information can be obtained from the artist or the music company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when invo@@ king the data from the server ( this can only be known to the programmer who checked the code . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally the adjacent mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly created ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more closely you can find the best choice for reading Audio CD ; see also that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for saving the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation of a enco@@ der , additional information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk which is installed on both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can always do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( lame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with every read of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device name is handed to the reading program , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available the effective device name can also be specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as left / entered as shown in the screen shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if you have incomplete information , please let us know if information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the internet by a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; the directory name and file name will be changed easily with the database entry and the directory name / file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both work equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls keep the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will not be created in the private folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.@@ 3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to release V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is set up in the previous section . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look somewhat different than the data fet@@ ched for one &amp; CD ; so you will learn the data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try not to find the &amp; CD , this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not happen , look for questions and answers in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the artist &apos;s name and album will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your mind best to your &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 step 2 : the CD editor - enter the CD data and the title of the first piece , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input box &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist ; album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats , see the code help to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the information about the categories . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next row in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the unit list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the button selection read out the read@@ out process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the Ri@@ der button to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window to check orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk , the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this error message appears when you are trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to be a problem for simultaneous reading and coding ( however two different pieces ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is in the queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed in the upper left part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is aimed at people who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , the following is true for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card cards and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , still am reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stran@@ gely , if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting from lyrics .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag on the k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and cast ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the playback button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after another . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and change the playback speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the Pause menu , interrup@@ ts playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can choose which events should be presented and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song , so you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of text events or rec@@ esses from the Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . in this section , you will see how you can use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find these in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , you must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button Add a song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the automatic addition to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . when you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they have been added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , select the next song , the next song from the menu item , or press the arrow on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump back a song , select the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when you leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the Change Patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet if you originally wanted to play a piano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary settings for playing a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
def@@ ins P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional keyboard ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see that de@@ ins are needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) , and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you will see how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument requires to play on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here the name drum patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key@@ map section is used to specify , how to see sounds on a particular channel or instrument . the use is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ maps are used primarily to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see , for example , the provided Key@@ maps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to replic@@ ate some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
n is the channel that is shown on the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option the keyword will of course be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option all events will be ignored . in this case patch x will always be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ name events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch nam@@ ing event with the value n it will be used with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then the value 40@@ 96 is used so that no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are in the map file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM is supposed to play a key@@ boards that will play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . these can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see which sounds are being played straight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you change an instrument the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tempo LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this lets you perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and a good synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before setting , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , click the LCD double @-@ click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop open a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or stop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go to this way ( if I play a MIDI file ) or just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window and drag the desired file to the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you decide to play in B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) written . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m studying math at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Má@@ laga . I am currently studying programming to collect MIDI files ; make music and prove sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; please send me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll list them ( if you want it ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might already have the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t have any money for it . I would like to stress that I can only continue programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also apply to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul WIT@@ TA , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , my thanks go to all these excellent musicians on the web , giving us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a sound card , you must &amp; k@@ mid ; comp@@ iling with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ SE@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name , was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / folder can be changed by editing , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category and select only the XML content of this part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes will be lost when you leave the edit mode , or select another group without setting the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying for the end @-@ animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; s ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by typing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special box for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and after error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output within and K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will always be done by typing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ H &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) and the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it .
as the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player only X@@ Video can use it should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason the video @-@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source and source source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there any hint of how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is required to compile &amp; tilt ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions , these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if support for this project or documentation is desired , please contact the ki@@ le ; website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have questions or for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within it a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users of &amp; Ki@@ le , can start working there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of Po@@ sters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use it can also use a lay@@ ie ( overlay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given , good books such as H. Cou@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex should be used : the Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &#91; document } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard from &amp; Ki@@ le , is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; out ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document classes : this includes the type of document to be created , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Movie &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coding : this is used to set the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ x should be washed ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; - documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration , they must be selected only in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users no longer need to worry about . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions , and further information is given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the inappropriate ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ boot { command } ) , an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will automatically create an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements , and latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ conscious of the sub@@ conscious element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own &amp; latex , recovery search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) is created , the corresponding row in &amp; latex ; -@@ Source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and is besides PDF the standard output type of &amp; tex ; and there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the description search , the elements of the DVI ; file are ne@@ sted with the editor and as soon as clicking on an element in the DVI ; file , the source text is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the DVI ; viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with other .@@ tex files . a project @-@ wide Master document can be set for project settings when using a project .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be transmitted in the tongues of tongues , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be found . the selection fields were developed for fast assembling of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Other can be used for quot@@ ing items such as key words , knots or references . the available options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above , possible ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using quote a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it works only if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ l@@ š@@ e is used for defining the font size , the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . , are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class include the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font is not specified at the beginning , it can also be done in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the button quick build . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le , for the storage automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , you should search for the errors . if you are using rapid construction , you should start the logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 will be created and only a few sets will be created within the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes are monitored only within the environment ( \ \ boot environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) , there is no indication ( number ) for changes within an environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , bold print , c@@ ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c pressure and is until it is closed until it is closed with a \ &apos; end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ &apos; emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : generates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { exposure } and finishes with \ \ &#91; quote } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le will follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the assistant has entered a bit of text , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can return to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a / Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Converter or computer screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are needed to create the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar allows to convert the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI , file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; latex ; files . to do this , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le needs to be set up ... tools can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to execute the search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on Pre@@ view search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; box ; opened and added to the corresponding line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should an error occur in case of using quick &amp; DVI viewers , an error may occur . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the log file tells the source code error source . in the editor you can always click on the errors in the log . the log file will always click on the error in the log and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the wrong line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear for selecting the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting empty documents , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the assistant can be used to quickly create a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi@@ c@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be created , saved , and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file will be opened or a new file can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically it is used moment@@ arily : \ \ Docum@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , the original template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any kind of &amp; latex ; if a simple way to create a template is desired , you should search for one on the Internet and can be searched using the steps described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users of &amp; Ki@@ le , can start working there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of Po@@ sters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called by the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be used in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ will \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par will be selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assistants can add additional diving marks . this is an own kind of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries mark the jump to the next or last jump mark . in doing so , this jump mark is automatically removed during the first input of a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; swelling always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports many environments and groups and therefore supports the following commands for text selection :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; box ; is that the casts are separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an enhanced meaning since this command also shows &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back@@ plot ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with its own commands for faster capability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description of Edit , select paragraph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; play . therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to create the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the \ &apos; begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , you can quickly lose the overview . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . editing Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing clasp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , there is jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a number of welded group brackets you can quickly lose the overview . this command will close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Lo , two simple reference marks are used as boxes . for the purpos@@ eful implementation it is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic insertion of double marks can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le , and La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also be used for specific settings ( e.g. emergency or French ) , and thus German or French announcements . there are also many other languages available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; drop ; not just a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a table environment , plug &amp; drop ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an incoming line break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users want to assign columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion this has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; three different modes have been installed . three of these modes work according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Ki@@ le ...
at the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ begin { environment } is &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ in { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to dig out the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are possible by selecting a command . alternatively , diving marks can be made easily and the desired parameters can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Settings box ; set up ... tilt , all settings can be made to these lists . you can select different promp@@ ts for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as general titles of the general language use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a large list of environment commands will have to be entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when invo@@ king the complete editing mode or Alt + Shift key , the setting will automatically be opened and \ \ begin . then the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and key by pressing the input key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; real@@ ises that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Settings box ; set up , set up ... make settings to these lists . this mode uses the w@@ aging list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately with some strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le is used for example the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode introduced over the editing process or the key r@@ tr@@ l + Alt @-@ space key , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large numbers of walls are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been noted that many entries in a document are more than once written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled . here , the threshold value for ad display can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / format / complete / mode / / or tex directory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Graphi@@ cs dialog creates graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is re@@ arranged , the pages can be re@@ arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ compile compile , create conversion and create view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 3 , converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file , and by means of old ; 5 the PS file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will appear each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... here , the following information is asked for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le , allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed on scripts in the vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can be modified in other versions of the API . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; latex ; is a fairly balanced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support the user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages , and a further &amp; latex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the type of format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and documents for a graphical surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the largest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click with the mouse or the Space button , open the viewer for the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many thanks to those who strive for the advancement of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we can all use in consideration of the &amp; GNU ; -@@ License . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; with the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures or day signatures from a list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for random signatures , an arbitrary signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for day signatures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for every day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will save you a blank signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ en section , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; s File Save or click Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create as many signatures as you wish . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as e @-@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mail privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove or click the symbol with the red cross section in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button below and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.5 . to attach signatures to your emails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on an order in the shown list , the cur@@ sor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a file name can be an absolute path to a local file , or only the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template or mod@@ us@@ name can be a fully qualified name , whereby the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template is also called my@@ template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first select the stopping point in the list of the current stops , then press the Rem@@ ove button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the status of a specific holding point is indicated in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Edit Settings dialog , on the page colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set , disable or delete a stop by pressing keys , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the symbols in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is collected and shown either in the stage manager ... Di@@ alogue or in the &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the various tools are available through the de@@ bu@@ gging menu , with the Insp@@ ection tool most important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on gradual exec@@ uting in the menu , a dialog for choosing the exp@@ ir@@ ation speed will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop the procedure , press the W key or select step @-@ by @-@ step guide in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use Kom@@ i as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de , knows my pro@@ c and what it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , let &apos;s leave it a graphical interface ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application needs inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found in the folder , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the desired folder in the other folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time it is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now there is a great graphical interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current work folder . if not , select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete the file with current file and select the file to be checked by other file - File selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for using a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) and specify the definition UR@@ I ; speci@@ fying the definition UR@@ I ; file selection is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in its home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you may benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . you can use the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; items can be found below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog allows to manage all of the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often in one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are intended to be self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member can have several roles in the project , as well as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and clicking the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold by which you are : text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nick@@ name and attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and notes , for more information on comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens . see also for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event promotions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , or a script that plays a file into CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipients list , and the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how to set up such conductors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add comments is easy , either the note entry from the editor context menu or the keyword keyword in a comment area followed by comment text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes can be sent as a defining member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project : team leader Sub@@ project manager Sub@@ project Manager : the corresponding domain or sub@@ project leaders should be cited as in the following examples below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up using Set@@ anta settings ... called . this dialog covers some pages , which are handled one after the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion , it can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically entered tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically included attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in a way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically close the optional tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; update Start and End tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic setting of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code , while typing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is e@@ jected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates periodically backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor section or in a separate view ( or documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reset window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings , by activating non @-@ demand requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change symbols instead of scripts , like the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . for different modes see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action caused by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of knots in the tree can be set automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group for Jav@@ ascript . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug @-@ ins are part applications of third party , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load the component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is denied the load . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse to load , if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , then the plugin is not available at the moment but it should be installed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 the de@@ bu@@ gger has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently only one plug @-@ in available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; app@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the button Options next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed , usually appears in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is produced , or it tells the plug @-@ in when a project is opened which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be respected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include it will be er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign@@ s the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction , and go to the next one as if there is the current one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help you become better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type editing pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers to simply use and produc@@ tively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , script languages and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two types of tool@@ bars ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; themselves . tool@@ bars allow a quick paste of tags into a document without the risk of a typing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the open descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version so available . ( for example html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and decl@@ aring if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail , and everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only element type above itself nothing else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this element can only appear once for each attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the source texts used to fill in the tag Editor dialog , and in the attribute tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a section and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list , it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur once in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements , which may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day , this element is a only element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ by &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to check Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this file , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for it within DT@@ D edi@@ ts . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action assigned to this action . by clicking the User @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detection settings , and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the script and interpreter must be given . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; % f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance will be added . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default entry . possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output written to the default output ; error messages are directed to the default error output . it can be specified which is to be done with the output written to the default output :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window , starts editing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill out all necessary fields , and add the day to the right tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that you can input when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it , before we have difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that represents action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22 x 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called off , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least a message to the user indicates that clicking on this symbol will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the button and continue using other tags , if there are any other tags , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or you should set them to multiple groups for a better overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note , how the Tren@@ ches support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absorbing all symbols , ensuring that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most remarkable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for ordinary users it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ative language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository , if someone has done it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path . relative to this file including ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation for something like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = n@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction = fil@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # Before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script will display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file he@@ aders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of separated context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / do@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / do@@ c for local and global use . then create a folder like do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else whom . at different places there is an email sent menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resources can be uploaded into our main archives where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download it . we recommend that the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . this ensures that the source of resources is guaranteed both for our team and for later users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message will appear with the name of the resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is currently supported by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format could be needed . it &apos;s the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor to be updated with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand and understand these fundamental concepts you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them about these fundamental concepts without understanding their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars and actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that only this user can use them personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ o@@ gli@@ ght the joint use of special tools and samples from all staff within the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Editor window , the construc@@ tional views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document setting , relo@@ ad , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rect@@ angles in the editing area lead to a further context menu on the processed document contents , such as basic editing ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the text under the cur@@ sor or open the file , when the character string under the mouse poin@@ ter is called a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the top of the editor window the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag that represents the tag you want to insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill different fields in a dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bau@@ man@@ arios ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tabs , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can then be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the categories depend on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available to use local templates only for the corresponding user and template in projects can only be used in the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the left mouse button to retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces , allowing you to change all the available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder do@@ c to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all the changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are comprehen@@ sively developed and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of tool@@ bars is the option to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; .
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely magni@@ fic@@ ant Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; constra@@ ined , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to extend as they need it for their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions and scripts and tool@@ bars it can increase productivity without having to remember any scrip@@ t@@ language syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has quickly evolved into a mature editor with many powerful features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more in the detailed documentation , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and taken care of by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ S@@ ign so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
enables you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go directly to a line number . this is very helpful , if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switching and switching problem re@@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as you change to the structural tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecast or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project , and the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded other input / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you will find the details explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load a tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local , or project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be set via settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load a &amp; DT@@ D ; , you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present fails the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , the tags menu contains a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can only be done with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu points listed above . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lift schemes depends on the plac@@ ards ; -@@ Version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enables status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of Po@@ sters , you will find details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and modify the sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should generate help in accordance with the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , for example after completing the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file is filled in automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , except for the processing of local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ de@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocols are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects this folder should be set instead of the standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project , multiple files or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; checked if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew , not hook up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection by credit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last screen of the new Project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard , and are described in . the additional entries are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional options to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the required de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as viewing a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting its own supervision for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , modified or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specific event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , you open and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to open another project , open project ... from the project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the project opens a project and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project manager gives free access to the files in the project , where the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... with the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , different profiles can be selected . profile contains information about the location of uploaded files . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is f@@ aded to prevent the removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk will not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name , or an IP address will work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be a lot of views in one project , i.e. various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be stored , opened , or deleted on the project tool@@ bar project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which you have the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows you to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best st@@ acked on the tool bar . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars will be treated at the bottom of the section adding tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which other actions such as tool@@ bars can be executed , the tool@@ bar can be executed , which actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bar ... and set Settings actions , set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates are basically text skel@@ et@@ ons ; code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions shown at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text ; i.e. images ; &amp; PDF ; s ; Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area over and over again . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and save as template Save as local template .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select text in your document and click File Save as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop down the templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this purpose , such as drag and drop or insert via the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very targeted approach . you can give head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically associate with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Video / apps / Qu@@ anta / Video / apps / Qu@@ anta / Video / apps / Qu@@ anta / Video / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three types described previously ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded once par@@ ental attributes are acquired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is enabled by default and dis@@ ables everything except for root folders in the template file . if a root folder is set , it would be explicitly activated . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing for a whole presentation to be equipped with the matching head@@ lines / he@@ aders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , using the context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn back to the source code where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the editor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source code editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . by selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large gap for slow motion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , the editing of invisible tags is possible when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just like the met@@ a @-@ elements possible . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template , pressing the button and selecting the appropriate file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor &apos;s use is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over tool@@ bars like in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag surrounded with text must be removed any other interc@@ eding tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the She@@ et Assistant or the Li@@ sts Assistant , are disabled . you will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; still lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available in a typical installation by &amp; k@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without need@@ ing . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder is for example a style template file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible the following entry is possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template named QNAP ME or a specified mode name will be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the stated &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sought @-@ after tip has to be dissolved for the UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start a shell . then enter the &quot; help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command to get an overview of the help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ TER ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if --@@ repeat is 2 times a@@ stated , the conversion will be 100 times executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input keys are treated as HTML files , if the support for this has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys to / from the commands previously executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as one argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template consisting only of the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the system of the user . on Uni@@ x or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data : the XML data or the XML document , which is processed by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ CA ; and lt ; U@@ RI@@ M ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; running time command : { Post _ BA@@ R _ quit _ BA@@ R _ quit _ BA@@ R _ quit _ BA@@ R _ quit _ BA@@ R _ quit _ BA@@ R _ quit , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function converted and k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , also helps you reconci@@ le and merge the complete folder . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger when someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can ease the typing by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
folder 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opening dialog makes it possible to manually edit file names , select a file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the file for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a folder ... if you select a folder , but if you select a folder for B and C , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately set an output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here , you can set options before starting the merge / merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you do not need to select files . you can simply close the dialog with the C@@ anc@@ el button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop , simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : at the moment , you can &apos;t drag and drop anything . just drop text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data may be lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible row in the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a difference is detected , one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line separating the text column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is represented dotted lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a Info row with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find next solved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time must also be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind , and may yet again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . carefully go to this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ forwards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the option sel@@ ector button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is checked , you will automatically copy the option to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; index files use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program , and will be restored next time ( menu settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( on some systems the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c script are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press En@@ ter or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line end type you prefer to save , the default value is the generally common choice on the operating system you use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page are identical . when this option is checked , this option will be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; . &apos; ) are ignored but they are treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see for details , see Docum@@ entation for comparison and merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must stop and restart and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control center . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the selection fields for coding , a short note of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different codes can be compared and merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the command command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white marks in text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ enco@@ ded over@@ si@@ ghted columns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can also be useful to view long lines . ( this option is in the window menu , too . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command becomes visible and not the file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it is passed on to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used for line calibration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this command command for line distance to turn input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s the found text in capital letters ) .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert characters ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now you can change the list as needed . \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line marks . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once , then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever with per@@ l some details are different . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data following the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for displaying and merging , while other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm sees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes , without actually performing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders does not start automatically , do not merge . to start the merge , you need to select the menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , you will be notified a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that date will be listed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or the object double by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again , these types are possible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the connection action can not be automatically selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered to be identical when their content is identical . then , folder also have the same color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , becomes red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : contradictory types of file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : contradictory types of file . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merging and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied and diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. When such errors are not removed , merging the folder cannot be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during merging , one file is processed after the other . it status column shows Finish when the merge occurred successfully , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file comparison method is selected full@@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , use the C as a target in the three @-@ folder merge mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a destination folder , check that all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current item , select Action of the current item or press F@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options performing , simul@@ ating and ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen , without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select again directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a message appears and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue to merge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section named directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point indicates whether these files should be displayed in the Ele@@ mental Tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links are shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is disabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that the link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain amount of security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified in this mode , and the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging . ( this is considered in@@ secure because the other file is not changed too . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also affect the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the Fol@@ der merge view remains visible to merge single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably you prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu there is also a menu item . you can use the current file merge from the merging menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : list menu : re @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency using Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things , you should note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently as a viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 then press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the contex@@ tual menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is used as a part , the patch file in the patch file . at least one of the files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or they will go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure inst@@ alls in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information on this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editor notes for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text , suddenly pop@@ s ; No sr@@ c left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . for this , use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a list of recent changes , please refer to ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 base folder ; -@@ Distribution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should there be difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you must re@@ vo@@ ke the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . under@@ stated in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space , to change their size , to finish or move them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both inside a desktop or on other working areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the context menu has only two entries to set up ... and end .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ space are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connect this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual work@@ space . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid is known as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally showing all virtual work@@ space in a horizontal row of what is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
der &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display and move the windows as symbols or with its content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and selecting switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . you can do this manually : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file you must log yourself as user root or assign them to your system administrator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use with &amp; K@@ mag ; you can read a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which constantly extends to new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you &amp; K@@ mag ; start a window like above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as selection window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can &amp; K@@ mag ; to create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window or the environment of the mouse @-@ display at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid showing the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter to the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed , and only the lower right corner can be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can paste the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts or stops updating the display . stopping the actu@@ ation causes the required CPU time to go against 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the refresh rate ( very low , low , medium , high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , relo@@ ading ( using the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and / etc . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains at the same place . it is intended to help people who have pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately also due to the mere preservation of the mouse pain is caused . suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer if this has not happened yet .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as you break the motion briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the button with pressed mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when switching on Intelli@@ gent Move , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . after pressing down the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button before releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt for the first time , but can be changed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and enter the General tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is selected , will &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset after the last press hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the intelligent shift should allow you to switch off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you will later be able to post@@ p@@ one the smart move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the clever move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens whenever you use a window manager , and move a window under another window manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you can even carry out a mouse click . hereby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the cli@@ p@@ board , but it will probably be a problem for them . here are some advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do not use the smart move if you just start using it and use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while pressing the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click , but this requires some practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , installed . that should already be the case on most system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and is correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pus@@ hes the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and treating the an@@ tigen of the mu@@ sta@@ est pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process begins , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can also be done with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages you can select often used passages without typing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a flow memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . you can select sets that are to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the side word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the voice output voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Cra@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you can find this command in the documentation of your language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output is made available and the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice of instant mode , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the flow memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second drop of the editing window for text passages , you can choose whether the text passages book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages book should be stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word completion page contains a list of words for word completion . in the main window , next to the input field , shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box contains the currently used dictionary for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you can create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , in the course of time , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt : button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is selected and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sets of the default memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu item is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu item is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location by clicking on the smart left side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page , and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for language synthesis for more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display an example of command line for setting voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display an example for the command line for the establishment of voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / slo@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
_ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in one line , and the option to send data as default must be enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice output da@@ em@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service which provides all &amp; node ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the position of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use t@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ generate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note , that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speakers synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar , or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service , allowing each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; , even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech output is used via the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows the creation of language output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) through the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de &apos;s voice output ; an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters , with which a text file can be read completely or partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ list mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ man / list@@ ings / k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use it , you must install and adjust the program to the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the Card Card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the General tab will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different types of voice , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the key@@ boards Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card will appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the speakers already created appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application has no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mou@@ sec@@ lick , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row further down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; actual system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voice type here , three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and female voice are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already use it . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text jobs . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can hold and read text orders . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it is running and on the other hand , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , stop and record text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , the Web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text that is to read and select Text from the main menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Desktop , the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text displayed . first check the text that is to read and select Text from the main menu . then select the speech output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also works when &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which informs you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message if your nick@@ name appears in an I@@ RC channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a &amp; node program supports K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to select mis@@ spoken words or short@@ cuts , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speakers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you use from the map is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text jobs . text jobs are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four job types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ arms , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . you can select the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string set@@ ter filters such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or by e @-@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ formers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with speech selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have selected a female voice for example on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were installed on the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of normal filters created . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern to set up character chain action filters . if these patterns are found in the text then the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ set by . the list is processed in the order displayed from top to bottom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to move the word marked , or the regular expression in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to hold a list of languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application ID running programs you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you are allowed to enter only copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions correspond with an entry in the box dialog . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you will find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ formers translate and XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spe@@ aker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , set on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program sends , sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker set on the card speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a value is entered here the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; node ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be accessed by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the language selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to save or load your language settings , or delete all settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speech selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if true . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the language edition API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synthesis to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; accessibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applications request voice output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface by &amp; k@@ de , from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text of the text to read and select a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console ; window . first start pun@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the above @-@ mentioned speakers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; - Shift filter set up , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( Male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ed b@@ oul@@ ders . what can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any synthes@@ izer which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech synthes@@ izer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c program is used for support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source repository for c@@ de@@ ort or the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you are using a speech synthes@@ izer , check first if the speech synthes@@ izer is working properly . you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which is used by the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr and the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is divided into single sentences . the user may return sentence or sentence , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be used . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will select , you will see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click Add driver on the list or click Edit to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details about the modules can be found here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you will need to enter only festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in case of voices , which are known and pun@@ ctu@@ ated , this setting is applied automatically . in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this gray , the voice selected by you will not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a spokesperson ( or forget to click Apply ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not yet running , it will appear in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of phrases and the currently edited sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series , you can move forward or return in the list selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , only text assignments are listed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , you cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equivalent to half and 200@@ DT ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the current &amp; short , click Apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks volumes . if you have a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; however , someone who is just entering the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; allow K@@ Noti@@ fy messages to read , start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select this check box to turn on &amp; Connect . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click on the Add button , a dialog box appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs , you have the following choices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard chooses the speaker that appears in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Event All al@@ erts for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list , and you can set the default messages as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all Noti@@ fication will be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output , speech speed , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 6 ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B Fil@@ ters ) . this can begin with the first set , since only the first set is synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add other set limit@@ er filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to get to know the selection of subscri@@ ber selection by selecting . turn on the speaker selection , change some properties and check the selection of the speaker . of course , you need to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter will be in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with the preview , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can pause or cancel orders on the card , even if the speech synthesis does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up when you start pun@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
boundary recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ular characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de , messages , warnings , messages , or output of screen re@@ aders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the normal set limit@@ er filter , you can paste it again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card selection card , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; P@@ act ; this speaker will select the speaker that best meets the original set features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired language properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box , if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language than that in the work environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all properties in the speakers area , which is best to delete the following , click on the standard speaker list and then use on speakers that are most likely to match the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , 0 represents the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr now cr@@ ashes when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any trace back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is not compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is not compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio output above AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . when I receive a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : to open PC@@ M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . see the AL@@ SA project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa projec@@ t.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in the festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ve / endor@@ se the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card holder unit .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is transformed into SS@@ ML ; ) De@@ activate the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter and set up the speech speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so the x@@ s@@ l file for converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added a separate string release filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not filter inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa projec@@ t.@@ org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; invo@@ ke the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Debian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command , and the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( packed with tar packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following modules for speakers synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Debian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs translated from sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD c@@ de@@ list echo t@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ e@@ fi@@ le.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you are using the synthes@@ izer , check first if your Spanish synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( Male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ IP / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from voice files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the introduction of the error corrections is not necessary ; you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . add the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; obtain and install at first Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then , download festival Czech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener linguistic synthesis which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fli@@ te is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthesis is good but the support is currently limited to a few languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load at least one German language file from the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , and un@@ zip them to the / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card setting , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ ed speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ s T@@ TS language synthesis . if the epic programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card speaker . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a fre@@ eware synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor talk speed can be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings through a standardized , integrated interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware can not be installed . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all displays and the setting of network features enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network settings module is loaded , if the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , select the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the non @-@ again questions setting the setting will be automatically set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before all options are shown in grey which means the settings can only be viewed . you can enter the system management mode by clicking the button System Management Mode on the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . this is divided into three tabs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog , set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be selected according to the system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Select manual , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . de@@ activating an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed in the list with buttons down or down in priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There is the Edit dialog displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the List Nam@@ know@@ ingly well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during the boot when no DNS servers are available . in small closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the List contains name @-@ known calcul@@ ators some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ep@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has several alias names , press button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a named host@@ name from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog familiar to your computer is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately implemented in the system . to activate the changes , you need to set the following command : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a graphical interface tool can be used such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this attachment , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide spread . therefore IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point which can be allocated to a valid IP address or if available , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 25 ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a specific lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes modified dynamically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if other content is to be found there in case of active DSL connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in the Su@@ SE@@ config file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the others who have been forgotten to start here , you know who they are you @ foo@@ .@@ t@@ ld &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs on a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the UNIX ; system program cr@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting &amp; cr@@ on , see a list of already created tasks and related environment variables . if you use it as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the task is de@@ activated , program names and parameters are not displayed and the description appears de@@ activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environment variables appearing here put out the otherwise existing environment variables , except force . with a de@@ activated variable , it will be disabled as a description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new task , select the task folder first . then go to the Edit New ... option in the menu to Edit New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the program to be launched here . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Mon@@ thly ( s ) as well as day of the week ( s ) , the program will be executed on 1 and 15 and Sunday , regardless of the day of the week , and on every Sunday of the month no matter what date they fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be activated when the c@@ ron@@ tab is saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a task , first select the task to remove . then go to Edit Tri@@ mming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the variables . you can also select one from the list of the most used environment variables , click the arrow next to the field for the variable name . these are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to send e @-@ mails from the rest of the program to another , than the normal address &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab is saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to remove . then go to Edit Tri@@ mming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click the variable to click the variable and select C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert an environment variable , you must first have a cli@@ p@@ board cut or copied . first , the insert is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit In@@ sert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then you can click the variable to modify ... or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . then the dialog box appears in which you can edit the variable as described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and set the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click the variable and select Activ@@ ated using the right mouse button . make sure the name and value of the variables are correctly displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific printing dialog options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it provides the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ool the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . notice &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be recre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything went smoothly , changes the tape drive symbol to indicate that the tape is included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before e@@ asing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; speci@@ fying by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not necessarily correspond to the format of the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape before being used . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting of tape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape , all the data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you initiate the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder will be backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a backup profile in the tree , only the files specified in the profile are backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files , and / or sub@@ folders are backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree , and select in the View menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the rate of data and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file , or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click one of the archives and select the menu item Veri@@ fy ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box appears . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the work folder for verification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the review settings , the dialog box appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the directory for the tape drive . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want from one of the archives , with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you confirm the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file with the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings , and you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current work folder , in which the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in it will be backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be assigned separately using backup files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; s ; he@@ als ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is active , transmitted , and dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command will load to the drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the e@@ jec@@ tor in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , dis@@ connect &amp; dat ; automatically e@@ jected to the tape . do not use this option in Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must report the block size for your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( n Byte ) The volume of this string is host@@ name : seconds with the name of the full name of the system on which the volume was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band in which the volume was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the content of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system files the various protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - is not shown to you , and it will not be opened with system administrator rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or according to entered string . the list of the log lines is now displayed automatically , so that only the log lines will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can , of course , select another entry in the protocol file . in the protocol file system log , select the process , and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the stage critic . the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut off setup dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you may want to display the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new string rows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log on the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more information about the sources of reference by &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;

welcome to &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; System V In@@ it Editor rather than &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the V In@@ it system is fast becoming the standard for running the system in the &amp; Linux world ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to boot when starting the system or switching to another run@@ level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first one he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , and you should see a line like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point you can have a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this you can fix / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and then fix it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument , such as start and stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that lets only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also move scripts between run@@ levels , or change position within a level by somewhere else . this will only happen when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the button to open the Properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine starts af@@ res@@ h . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the LI@@ LO prompt , enter the lin@@ ux single button and press the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) will simply end without a message if your configuration files are not present or correctly set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after making changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some learning flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card will be created on which shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password management card appears , if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d should be installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this card only appears if there is at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem , and the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the file system with limited space limitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select Add user or group , or click the appropriate Add button of the tool bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change time to boot the default operating system , remove , modify , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
