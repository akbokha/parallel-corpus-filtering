<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture look sharper. you can use it rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocussing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process paints a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"" "" "" "JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. however, raw format images must always be sharpened during processing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>

<seg id="491">"" "" "" "there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or amount will amplify the effect." "" "" ""</seg>
