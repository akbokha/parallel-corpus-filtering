<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to look sharper. actually it sharpens a little psychosis. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"" "" "" "refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process paints a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colors are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"" "" "" "in JPEG images, a camera has been used to use internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="487">"" "" "" "you should be careful with this, since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correcting soft marks and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview help to edit the picture. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"" "" "" "there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artifacts. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1; & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"" "" "" "noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & ksysv; System V Init Editor rather than & ksysv. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "" "" "the V Init system is fast becoming the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g., because I don't know about it myself: -)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without a new installation and re-formatting. the kernel looks first at / etc after an init file. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d Dort, and the following additional folders:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot when starting the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as setserial that is only launched once. such calls may include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">"" "" "" "you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port." "" "" ""</seg>
