&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American writers and run his sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less journalist who wanted to fill the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freely after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US was only strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as it is said beautifully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly critic@@ ises his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number , the candidate nominated by the party ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people around the world , a deep believer with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump &apos;s world outlook did not match Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours watching Phoenix S@@ uns playing the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for her life and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still suits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me get used to the complexity of American life with a lot of patience and grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were Andrew Tast@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and their em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nom@@ inees republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arran@@ ging people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , most of which are white , voted for ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to up@@ lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . O@@ B . : as much as &quot; rebellion of the white against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; words play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash ) as the great Van Jones nick@@ named has killed exactly what America has done so spectac@@ ul@@ arly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , but it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white Americas bears this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices grew lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; he was corrected 36 hours later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is now tr@@ umps land , said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music , which lives with the waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra composed of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian &apos;s English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse and violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Bon@@ gos , Bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually on the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with restored instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the Children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed when Fa@@ vio showed something that he had never seen before , a violin made from waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill harmonic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the world produces about one billion tons of garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its inspiring drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world , fill harmonic harmony follows the orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orchestra , even before Pope Francis , played its music : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly bon@@ ded , and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this type on their coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ oren , Mozambique and Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while campaigns against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and circulating information between individual countries , the actions today are happening in real time , with track@@ able at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships very carefully , when they move on the open sea by satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such studies may show whether the participating boats have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to regain some 20 million USD in lost revenue , losing the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen inv@@ ading Eastern African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries which attracts the region commercial fishing from around the world . among these illegal fishing fishermen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , actions include like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , stating fantasy names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i tries to close now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its foundation , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . they discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has pursued and found escape ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority for Com@@ bat Cri@@ mes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system , which aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to detect suspi@@ cious ships more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships switch off for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can display the position of every single track@@ able ship worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what to do , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also sc@@ are them off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships that previously were fishing without license and had hardly had consequences , now know that they will be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets which were prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also have to copy , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat illegal fishing , in accordance with the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia reported his first great triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a collaborative way of protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .

the movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on the matter , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , gathered on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( such as : the suppression of Venezuela ) , both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but eventually the removal of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in her latest article : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where the inflation and rate of violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was the only way to rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ ze its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the torture day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was planned to continue the blocking of the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of the National Assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to stop police forces including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear any skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic introduces the round that forms the amount of suppression per day : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dictatorship has oppressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official publication procedure , which has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , taking little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis from their point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took us so much , but also fear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interview was translated into English , and is published with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a now adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows what great power a parent has about his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the gym to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the gym . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended your ERP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pass only that they will not escape one day , and I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought that would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first and last time , he left me waiting at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , he pointed to an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over there , the prisoners are tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a couch which men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a bed and metal feathers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seldom put a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch there , in it was app@@ alling ... like a dirty win@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I immediately recognized the smell , and I realized that the smell of a body is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , how is it possible that a person can deal with another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wearing eye band@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused during the trial ) and took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father realized that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were thrown into a pit , and were slain by soldiers , and buried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this , because my father told me about it at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero stroke a man there , killing him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survivors , the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , charges the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the path you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived the torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting people and the disappearance of their bodies , in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; boot@@ y &quot;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house , and steal everything in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded in rage , hit me , scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down for what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I was there to testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops further , and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have executed people during dictatorship , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could have put them into prison , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their bodies would leave for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did these people not also have families , whom one could give up their mortal remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act , which one can do to a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course , something remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , I was even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought of showing my father was during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was accused of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience because of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt che@@ ated inside and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he merely replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , I received the first ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me , that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and charges against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases sentenced to life imprisonment and nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven of the 54 def@@ endants , originally , died during the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial to be led by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witnesses of a particularly failed translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word for the &quot; elderly mot@@ orists &quot; is wrong@@ ly translated - maybe even with malicious backs &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself , from 1 to 20 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing the original photo of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mistake was noticed by Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the appropriate term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers . &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blo@@ gger reported , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are truly sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) in our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who have been involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the named re@@ porter published in the article published on Yahoo revealed comments on the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently vac@@ ate against older car drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is the translation really wrong , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia

there are many reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source language and have an active language knowledge to translate it into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators are in the target language - should not be native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which might produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers studying Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees make translations into the company internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is also widely used , often with funny results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the verb@@ s and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not read or even understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless , but from large companies or by government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ om@@ munic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing , that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ Fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es who carried the protests live in Car@@ ac@@ as was taken into custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government is becoming increasingly difficult to access multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by the architectural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where she could not eat together with the family who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before her graduation , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proudly saying about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for her family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over her minor son or her minor daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do house@@ work for many days that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family , whose daughter believes in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family that welcomes the girl and whose exploitation with the faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , they never know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ rowing in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta at Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra &apos;s former military family and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo which works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra returned to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the young girl &apos;s life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go bl@@ amed deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies , requiring that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; could be in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions both boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the married couple , and almost 60 civil society organisations , demanded a rapid investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to murder the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be landmark - if Paragu@@ ays first appeared in the Paragu@@ ays history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers had to work all the time , and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that her even had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning , preparing breakfast for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but I couldn &apos;t eat less . &quot; I could get more books from the house &apos;s library than eating out of the refrigerator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read leading articles from opposition newspapers such as Sen@@ der@@ o or El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to have no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their masters feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying , and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realise that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school , or in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share job ads for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday when possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the state , who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the author displayed again once again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you , I will write again when something is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery and cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors who were ens@@ la@@ ved by the Spani@@ ards and the indigenous people in Paraguay .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bill of law writes Egyptian users of social media , to register with the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , edited by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a position would be set up which has been commissioned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their right names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video coaching and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make registration . it is not clear how to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Pat@@ rons of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a username and password to get blocked by the fire@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level on Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , it is not known until now that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require permission or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislative body of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq work animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this particular species of Leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs by Nature Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his works have been published in numerous international publications including the TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meyer filmed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and H@@ BO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2009 to 2014 Meyer lived in Northern Iraq , where he founded the first Iraqi photo agency with Metro@@ graphy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , the progress made in the recent six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the triple catastrophe was triggered by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai that lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a vivid pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast which had both experienced the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone for that reason alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the lives of the local residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority , and the survey results of those affected themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( which were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures ) Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , still six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( which is ev@@ acu@@ ated by dwell@@ ings , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still ende@@ aring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still lives in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this case . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated that were home to disaster shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have resum@@ ed their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered large @-@ scale damage in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma has also been far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent again , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to earn their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it is for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its issue of commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper improved its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , atomic accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were transferred to permanent replacement homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 2017 state , 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are older than 50 years old . they are known because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people come across from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it appears at first glance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love for music re@@ treats the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer struck him at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a march against austerity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the University University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated him this Saturday , and now moved him into an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer can be seen , who was attacked by a punch stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás declared that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he struck Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a video of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( around 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment while remaining in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be brave and Mat@@ eus .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : in this case the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he had participated in the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who was hit by a police officer .
police gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police missions on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Euro MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the Brazilian media del@@ u@@ ded street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protag@@ onist : a window window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported a broken glass window , in order to illustrate their titles in illustr@@ ative fashion with a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window window , than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also be recognised , if you are strictly opposed to any form of material damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by the head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges , Cuba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the popular local community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stops every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , the output amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar cane crisis on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased over a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion , not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially written documents which differ@@ ed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could have approved any withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best developed industrial zone of Cuba , and the most important work lat@@ ch , has been wi@@ ped out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to the workplaces and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know whether during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for five years their factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years , the popular community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to mut@@ ate , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , but also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the perspective of the future , many young people left the region at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created which serves not even for the supply of the municipality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continue to be impressive , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the site where he began to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to the old soldier , to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been tor@@ ment for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

teenagers of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops are now offering mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original workshops were led by pedago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus raises the assumption that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , speech , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video of the school &apos; Na Sam@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia talks for example the history of Highway 16 including &apos; Highway of tears &apos; - a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
most cases were not solved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youths involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , there is also a translation into English , translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to go on my days on Earth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will take our cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we as youth have lost our way in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe , that we will rise one day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a poor life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can grow and move forward to our youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can do what the Creator has appointed for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the commentary section the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also added a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( for the rest ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which is served with plastic models of the dishes ) are exhibited by each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers see themselves in these plastic courts , and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an entire industry , dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a lot of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now in special sale : new mobile bands decorated with plastic courts as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ es@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this part , too , was manufactured for the Tokyo exhibition in the Tokyo Station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ intern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;ll be the only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # Dem@@ ini@@ i &apos;s # Dem@@ ini@@ i # Dem@@ ini@@ i # , for the ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video will give you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi area , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the gri@@ eving or the par@@ ishes who have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind each body , behind each bone find in hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as much as possible as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives , &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who scans secret tom@@ bs after his son each weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we asked to go and search for graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business at El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co , &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form they appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I pass on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the titles of titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she continues to write :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of criminals when they go through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , when hist@@ ories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ genu@@ ity of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and are still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. , from Mexico City , wrote the entry &quot; Four Mon@@ months black@@ mail in the main city district . &quot; she describes how armed criminal month paid money from her business until she destroyed not only the business but also tore her family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only contact , if it is absolutely necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would dissolve my deep rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells his self how to cook an egg and make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water and sugar and milk powder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg , one for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life is made of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood had already past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders based on data from the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosecutor &apos;s Office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just a few of the hundred thousand stories , which leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages on which he links contains images on which violence is presented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this false link between image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it raises questions about our longing for images to news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local representatives described a fire@@ ball , covering dozens of houses including a cinema nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the streets scattered , cor@@ rupted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people were burned to the unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al pictures of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are lined up on the floor while people watch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but here , history does not end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , the same photograph has been introduced several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically from atro@@ cities before which they had to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses and shops were burned down , and car@@ cases were found in streets and bushes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were dis@@ car@@ ded , shot or burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the help of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here the picture emerges from the DR Congo , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to providing arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the p@@ ong image also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some caused by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabia message that was fal@@ sely claimed by President Burma . in addition , she had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image taken from the DR Congo to illustrate this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global reach of false data
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 , and are actually coming from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; reverse search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 images ( status dated May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixing mask of private parties , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have forwarded false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of the abuse of use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below ( which have been inter@@ connected in some cases ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some cases , which can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers , about the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available on Tin@@ eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message was fal@@ sely alleged that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , bringing the story along with the image of S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication , the picture continues to be included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on students murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near @-@ standing journal An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture was later put into circulation in the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be links to Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image of the DR Congo showed up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were attracting more attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
USA 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as a cover for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message supposedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussions like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the ho@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Embassy in which the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ inet mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer entirely trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally , they have educational file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ ming ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the persec@@ utions of Christians by Muslims , or to the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued , compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are countless people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests this mood of false and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution of violent images has already been discussed extensively ( here , for example ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal equ@@ ates to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but can be used diver@@ sely from context or mis@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , each examination of false al@@ ign@@ ments should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ translated ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or even impossible to translate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these un@@ translated words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all resist , stub@@ born to every attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand precisely what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ Trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s language , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or sl@@ oth you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they resol@@ ute other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of this &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

new photos : the silence of an abandoned Japanese village
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I have managed to add the section raff@@ le Japan to my portfolio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just published a video interview with the street photographer Lee Chap@@ man , Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Chap@@ mans &apos;s blog and portfolio , his photographs are on his Tokyo Times Inst@@ agra@@ m and Twitter accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Sri Lanka , dealing with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ fill disaster in this decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused by heavy rainf@@ alls , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya started over the banks in 15 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people were missed because of the floods and slu@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rainf@@ all occurred on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle is flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents trapped in their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps , too , have prepared to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fac@@ ebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian assistance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taxi Call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the disaster centre is informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and provide remedi@@ al measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

photo by Sah@@ sa Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust her my four year @-@ old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute , we still call gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , we channel rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar@@ an , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has developed in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they ex@@ cl@@ ed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide , there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we do not look at all equally .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , are not Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being separated from the lim@@ b
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what pictures do you think , when you think of him ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another exists in the duk@@ k@@ ingly images of Muslims , the Western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid moved the story behind these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these images still stand out today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to shift them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , defective nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even vote for their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their scar@@ f in public buildings , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead moti@@ ons for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought home with slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children will become the target of anti @-@ viral attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we relate to them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to reach the 1.7 billion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves , which help us to understand the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the 1.7 billion narrative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African , African Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of ten US Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants , coming from 77 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my erst@@ while parents arrived in New York to live their American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ repar@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now ir@@ repar@@ able , Muslim and American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ching my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sh@@ ar , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim , or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already defective picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we relate to them , Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s scar@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its most ugly forms , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is attacking our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot possibly fit into a drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born to Muslims , but I was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , whis@@ per@@ ing her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of them , I repeat three times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to me is the image of my grandmother on her mother@@ ly side with her sisters , how they win a competition of the art of flor@@ ence in Kar@@ achi twenty years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a Muslim means to speak the prayers she had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , a company with the name Ehr@@ lich British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my well @-@ known grandfather cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was struggling to rule his family in the area of India , which he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a Muslim , it means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago , over a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he introduced the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there were planes , he travelled in more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deeply into our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ seen history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across the continent , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is home to the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic lawyer named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , and a journalist mean the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people set up structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regi@@ ments , which began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just those countries , who are bombing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we dis@@ assemble in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those whom we do not tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically sound picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversations that we have to lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous expressions that we dis@@ continue in our news editors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet been given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today a missing Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things , which I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie where one is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are not the terms we usually take in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; have been scientist Stan@@ ford himself four decades ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and me are bombar@@ ded during the Women &apos;s March , while he already bombar@@ ded some countries and &quot; to other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story telling , by Flickr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a possibility to contact someone here , and now , despite a language barrier ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported on another initiative of Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin exist in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been organizing events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often tends to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers confront their history first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience is informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona in Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to extend this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ fixing state debt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of a new audit of public debts of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the March started at the Bu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was called by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Neur@@ onal Ex@@ am@@ ination of Deb@@ ts ) and the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Church Assembly of Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts to be accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to find a decrease in pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island , not in the territory of the United States , is suffering from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a Non @-@ profit Non @-@ Profit Organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , director of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , it means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side to hand to look beyond the mist that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about his present state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , what have we given up from times of extreme convi@@ ctions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them into account by an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a vital role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that formed Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ ule &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pres@@ cient than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el opened the door to technology , teaching me to use both computers and smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ ling which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .

here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens every time you visit you
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I sink in the world of your charming eyes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and monitors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I go into every detail of your voice , and words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I carry with passion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your eyes say goodbye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bring back all the moments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bear witness to myself , that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year passes , my soul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in your cage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bas@@ ule &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested , or disappeared into force by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for release of Bass@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption condemned post @-@ release director again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine , where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the de@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money stem@@ med from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which claimed the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not undertake a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , Centr@@ o de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to recru@@ it the Director : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency , and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that even the company should have led a disciplinary procedure against the re@@ acting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company apparently held no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ iz@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contradictory &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could give lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ref@@ und@@ able !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to come back and to serve the State * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but instead served itself only by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as a source of in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ s prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of selling also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and escaped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely con@@ notation con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that Po@@ sts , in whom they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use , were cens@@ ored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( flas@@ k ) or &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( Cur@@ tain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post of one of my friends was wi@@ ped today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; curing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write on Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should do instead is carefully analy@@ sing the post , checking it by checking the next words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I was alert to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the song , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; stools &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook automatic cens@@ orship provided for much ridi@@ cu@@ le , among users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no hate speech but were removed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese Text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry , and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure , the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have looked better on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age now lies at 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago became a partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , who were stri@@ ved to aboli@@ sh laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should look for their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and some doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in early 2017 the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the President of the land must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the trans@@ formers of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it was decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws were finally changed to pa@@ edi@@ atric mono@@ gam@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who suffers from a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is now illeg@@ ally in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel Jackson thought that it took me long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ing news ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the age @-@ free age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation , 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft to am@@ end the marriage law was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of whom were present during the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs voted against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is not allowed by law any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Co@@ al Par@@ rot shiel@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many thanks to all the activists , who have challenged him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to bring his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to address the issue differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legally or still the norm , even though there are laws they fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption , coinci@@ ding with Russia &apos;s national holiday , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was h@@ acked by the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - however , it remained in the cache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is # gent@@ disappeared
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor shared Y@@ ar@@ news &apos;s local news service that they were h@@ acked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , international dark@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist@@ ed the blocking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many technically tech Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ators ) which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only a screen@@ shot and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror - an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages if in the respective country Wikipedia is brought forth .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and co @-@ workers at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one attacks another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essentially , the server continues the request for the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that motivated him to wear a camera , and try to gra@@ vit@@ ate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described on Facebook , how this first class situation helps him with his work : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just rested at home when suddenly called me Navar@@ res@@ h ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately , I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to gn@@ ggle up pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S@@ ag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know , because he ris@@ eth Tig@@ ers from face to face : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b itself from the view of the sheep , when sleeping ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late in the evening , the light is too weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the book suddenly appeared . he immediately sits down , looking at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , a revised version was re@@ published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , women &apos;s greatest care is to avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm in life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a floo@@ d@@ light and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with her name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far less excuse to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main tal@@ k@@ ative theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and at the same time made them to am@@ bass@@ adors of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini in their discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she decided on this subject , because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not speaking out loud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all blame and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never thought about it until this discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to engage the discussion with an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of their husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only secured herself , and another decided to let the whole fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still in adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on their behalf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put the women into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding , and the situation ended in violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the chin @-@ up red dot on the forehead showing the marriage status : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the chin @-@ up point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just laugh@@ ed , and I stopped wearing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely stopped working , but think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally we pack lunch and water , and go out into the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they seem to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after much debate and discussion about the advantages of the choice of dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , we have only taken little steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tasted it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and are not members of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Z@@ inno@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club gives each of us confidence , that something will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from dis@@ crete groups in India , and make videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; messages from those who experience them , &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative tag
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese t@@ witter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the turn of the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was inter@@ viewed by Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of his first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here realized quite quickly , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all love Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll , John L@@ enn@@ on , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places that are related to the band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London , and ran across Abbey Road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same thing we did last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as the R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?

that is how the day is gone today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we hope that you are part of it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the BBC &apos;s police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that successive attacks on GM men were registered , in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this led to the fact that the UN 2016 , in the South African country , conducted a mission to investigate this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting in Arabic blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ ule &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who lay down themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , Bas@@ ule &apos;s stay and condition were unknown , when N@@ our@@ a was told by Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web @-@ movement proves the honour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have committed themselves in the last five years for his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 and the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countless of those who were arrested by the regime or disappeared into force , were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( Stat@@ ute ) after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China said Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal issue , &quot; he told a spokesman , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , China still maintains calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or enable him to go abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has put together some international reactions .
United Nations united nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to an end , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , since exports had largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as it announced in an explanation on June 30 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans wanted him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P released the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy challenged a fur@@ ious response from China , with the expression of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , based on the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope Li@@ u receives all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 7th and 8th , Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great doubts whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u &apos;s attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to protect its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to leave on 29 June , to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it was no further information whether France would eventually pick it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China urged China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very ap@@ preh@@ ensive in an explanation of June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he was severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question may appear sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at international level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere , this remark has spark@@ ed a debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s single political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , with most people commit@@ ting a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ sting logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently led by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , since they are better suited to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam provided answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he clo@@ aked such questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire shared address of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s testimony , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the head@@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , who is the leader of an approaching generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam have committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy@@ ous spokesman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore perform their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are we the citizens of a city , or the inhabitants of a city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one ever said , Singapore is a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; replied I . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be poli@@ te to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my clarification usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Canadian differs from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans , on the other hand ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage , to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a free healthcare !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , there are no weapons ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , we often say &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not like these guys , south of the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wouldn &apos;t be so easy for me , if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are , however , some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be fun - just like the humble , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmless , that is in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that happen around one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk over the fence across the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ aks Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ odi@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 was able to restore power and to restore the civilian government in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations his girlfriend does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially in relation to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary inj@@ un@@ ction , which grants absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; Settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , a strict peti@@ tions against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) prevailed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two days later , the army came to a put@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long jail sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itate the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life continues in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Greece , Asia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ war society re@@ covers only very slowly in east Asia Min@@ or , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Asia Min@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , demo@@ cra@@ cies , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such settlements are also called gh@@ ost@@ ers , in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ storey dwelling blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ kov &apos;s , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts talking , and it is hard for him to finish this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambigu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ kov@@ ka , which are still one or two families , can be seen on balconies where laundry is dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother forbi@@ d us to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbi@@ d us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers a little to her friend , and suddenly she abandoned the destroyed building and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial help from her daughter , insi@@ sting she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when holidays are , we visit ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her husband and five common children , G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ed with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , it reminds of the village life before the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently we bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each child , Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was there , they keep pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over time , it lost its anxi@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when our conversation bows to the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ball flies out of the window , and another boy follows him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now persec@@ ute the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while they are walking , some of them throw stones onto the ruined buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure im@@ mortality in their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossing migrants across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in a ted@@ dy bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night , the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital when she is ill , she bu@@ ys drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ão , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sebasti@@ en family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a beard sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he responds with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebasti@@ en travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to regain her husband and three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months , selling SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wonder if he will contact Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests can send their often text messages when they left to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains , that their Christian faith is the drive of their work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , while other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ educ@@ ator , offered him its roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family is still living there and trying to decide where the next steps should go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corri@@ dors , the travelers consult their teleph@@ ones quietly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with many photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens she made her a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she laughs sad while she imag@@ ines her short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se Fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; it repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by t@@ witter users , let us know what else to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone message indicating the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the app would determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this app with min@@ ors for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often impose extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from a check@@ point in China published on Twitter , published on Twitter , showed photos from a check@@ point where the police checked the people randomly , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have forced people to use appliances , which are intended for elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ wa@@ xing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from De@@ ar China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ? ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can unlock the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Reg@@ ulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the statements of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government departments , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable disks , lap@@ tops and media memory cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and sets them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those which refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you watch and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that makes all honour to their name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who has cast down in a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow metaph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is moving on the axis of un@@ hei@@ sm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proved his power over us , destroying even the simplest concepts we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five young people were swept away during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the districts sought after , only my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat , after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied to a magnificent image that filled my expectations completely and perfectly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit out of the lamp , but it &apos;s just not interested in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with military security buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you back your voice back to the office of the security service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sorry to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing , when I replied , &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word about what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this day , the sten@@ ch of this cursed set is in my nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the courtyard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am presenting all the details exactly , before I enter the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike anything else , they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and must immediately put me on without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old proven communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned , that my cellular comra@@ de was a &apos; first @-@ aid &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after some hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps it was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him , if I remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ elled in the fruits of my head &apos;s garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries out , every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ation on 13 . S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the secret was revealed : to protect and prevent state security from us and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stupid man ; at least it seems to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than protest you and protest to demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to being punished , even though I had nothing done to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in punishment , in all their diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cries did not suff@@ ice him enough , so that they exchanged the tube with a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator used to work as a waste collector or whether this belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four wires to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and was no delight at all , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electricity f@@ lowed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor stretched out , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared , and the pain was there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , this was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me like a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be still and keep you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they always released me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; once he sh@@ uts down to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what you can rely on , is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ spotted lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lives in the top floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( like : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his way of thinking and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he w@@ anders a special appeal against US foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considered his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian P@@ oultry of the second generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Jord@@ anian law also states that food consumption is illegal during Ram@@ adan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically speaking , the mu@@ gs speak lou@@ dly hot coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ds of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one throws a glance into the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ adan , not to land in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ers , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert had just been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the established legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; that continue to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement might not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a more and more clearly @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which is clearly apparent in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly laid @-@ down unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official fron@@ ts left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan is still lacking in the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be detained in@@ definitely and for their release , years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but cle@@ ars that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was informed of politics , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs that are political at the core , can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this song , one verse frequently repe@@ ats itself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want - either faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were highly cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later realise that his comments were torn from context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ ova was able to work openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why could Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former governmental representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s Association , reasoning that they were critical to the problems associated with deep @-@ rooted corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will engage in real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will move on and consequently resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Centre on Crisis Reporting , a member of the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uta , in A@@ om@@ ori , is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ar@@ mor@@ ed cars and drums and dances of more than a thousand years have been passed in the armies of the region that force E@@ mis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I am looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two cars are just to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seldom , outward appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ bery and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1,5 % of the population in this region will not feel safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , appearance and also the original hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens move into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are experts competing against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school located in El Cal@@ la@@ o found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dresser &apos;s art which allows them to find work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ou@@ tri@@ ght , affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the Gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps , subjected to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock wore their weapons , must now be integrated into their lives as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred for gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , which should then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people whom we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and want to build a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they did before , in order to receive the commands of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after commit@@ ting the letters , a former fighter led me through the gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and said , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; he replied , &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I embrace him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered for a discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice from the state affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear those people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament , peace would rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take arms and protest for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , a policy without arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ tot@@ owa , and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert , hasn &apos;t come up overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published involving the tow@@ ing , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ ens and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since her childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sexual equality of her country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for fear of her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day , I was told that someone needed my help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had no money , so I took her up without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost consciousness , and finally woke up again in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , some women got everything along and started scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two tears in my right lung wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : in which cases were you placed , in which the men or women of the women ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very grateful to him for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him , that he is respect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February , I received threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they presented absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to show up on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was just bad speech and Phot@@ oshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother got too much , and she laid a rope around her neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark windows and a number plate was on top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought her without registering myself , without knowing anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke my old SIM card , and threw it into the tr@@ ash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived , and checked in to the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to invo@@ ke my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be safe , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our people know , in which hotel you are hiding . you even know your room number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , I still carry in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I actually trouble watching the person remembering her from her past - that is , my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do your friends do , those who have survived ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that no people were arrested and tortured during the adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , I mean , they are likely to charge their relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are there even more gay men in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me , there would not be too many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are arrested there so that they can be presented later as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television claiming they had attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but immersed in a targeted way in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is this only a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone , who was detained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says many people have disappeared in this prison , after having grown beard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there has been nothing new of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they just took them along .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits so far there were no reports . but we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known already in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was true , I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian li@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is this possible , under the sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes and bore leather jeans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never curved me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men and young people met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often say it to children , when they make fun of sick people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so , they closed their eyes before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased me nor beaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , you could sense how the people in the city started to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first , looked at you with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : which activity do you follow now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , I still work as a activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people , when I sc@@ rap@@ ed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a Muslim , and I want to help those who need help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make white foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys in them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ i who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ines who , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they have them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you know , many think about a transi@@ denti@@ ality to men who love men and they believe that you are mistaken for sex to make more intimate experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion , to be precise , different life settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not feel ashamed for my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not , whether I have a partner or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not sad at all , therefore - I simply know that I am now myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the past few months , there has been a sharp rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married , and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself , stuck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution of the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , based on a large part of the Arab ancest@@ ry living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , some of the most valuable and most valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population only gets little of that wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian regime systematically depri@@ ves Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government also built a large number of trun@@ ks to diver@@ t water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate , among Arab a@@ haw@@ ks , rose to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who completed a work , completed a 55 % secondary school and 45 % completed university degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy , &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to this , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is the reason for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not favour Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who themselves call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women is a global epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still trans@@ vers@@ ed across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of this , I know and know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I suffer double , triple among them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet : when I &apos;m on skin color , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention the way we have always been subjected to racial separation and discrimination , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &apos; Kum@@ ba , my Lord &apos; to achieve the equality ( some ) of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or on the other hand , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women face a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect myself as a black woman who refuses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her mind , which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ n compla@@ ined : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alised entity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to promote their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to close white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender , for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I prefer to release myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism , calling me to the movement of femin@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move us into spheres that are created by us for ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) states that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement , of whom the black woman is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman , I am recognized as a part of this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither excessive nor ignored , nor denied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development can lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was filmed , filmed and released for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities who can tell their stories in their own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; The crying women &quot; in order to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region , and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by the architectural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Ref@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the know@@ led@@ geable ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women pay an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence can contact the prosecution authorities at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contents 1 F@@ acts and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation beats and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , a researcher for gender issues at Centr@@ o de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General posted 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peace courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically mal@@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of mental mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true scope of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of mental abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offen@@ se , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

invisible fail@@ ings and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but she still gave up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that once , I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she didn &apos;t leave Carlos so long , and did not leave it earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had a certain complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not born in Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I Beli@@ eve You &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he started beating them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an opa@@ que legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known under H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prin@@ ter ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ nen@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill of the law fores@@ ees to explain and punish Fem@@ izi@@ d as a stand@@ alone criminal offen@@ se , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the law text was changed in some ways in order to win the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are banned in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill had fores@@ een the bulk of ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to pay an ad and would like to receive a secure housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ human relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to pay as long an ad until abuse is no more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack its victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by the architectural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Ref@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman , independent media in Oman one year after the ban on a newspaper continues to be attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking paper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman has been ruled by sul@@ tan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has been the only Sultan in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Commander of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rule of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , to restrict public freedom , including freedom of use , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which , since its foundation in 2007 , reports about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces arrested I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who appeared in the paper on 26 July 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured the Supreme Court judge in Oman to lift a verdict in an inheritance case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the board of editors , was invited from ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information gave the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and also ordered the final closing of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of breach of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3@@ 800 US dollars each . a one @-@ year prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after having found the use of an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was set in the amount of £ 5,000 by Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , Al @-@ Ha@@ j convic@@ ted one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Japanese government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; closure was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally signed a further statement in which the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closing of Az@@ ami and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further violations include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease its operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Japanese authorities to : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j acqu@@ aint immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman are able to exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including court cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : for a lack of healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious impact in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centr@@ all@@ ab@@ or at the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself explored the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : what do you think is the important current scientific topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is no basic research here , we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that publishes articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the 1980s , Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many sorts of salad it can get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cereals or car@@ tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer as his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the United States and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source , breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance that this name sounds like that , as if the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed it , and not immediately eliminate them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the discrimin@@ ated professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to it , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open source movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to continuing their seed freely at their disposal , in contrast to the patented Se@@ ed and Plant traits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is continuously shr@@ inking because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights that are becoming available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all anti@@ trust characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it very useful for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of Vie@@ wing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those by which their flavor or color improves , through which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats like p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is due to more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , these instructions help others to get the same result with another method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not promoting innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if one has to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time , money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mor@@ ton bot@@ hers in the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants make them themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how plants do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret to nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant breeders in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large estates and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are masses of her@@ bi@@ cides , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just in a hurry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who are active in international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the independent plant breeders , Frank Mor@@ ton , looks for salads in his far@@ med garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Mor@@ ton believes that breeders through the prevention of plant pat@@ ties would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in the Open Source breeding program , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds , and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ ements is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission , the European Commission , announced that conventional plants should not be patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on Open Source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from whole East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend for planting seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Douglas , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official start of the official launch is scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report to help farmers grow and improve seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a context that the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the eleven best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth , &quot; focusing on nature monuments and nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award ceremony took place on 7 October 2017 at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , as part of which the winning photos were presented in an exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the month of May , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 motifs about natural heritage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a thousand of these pictures are already used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all winners received certificates as souvenirs and other prizes , such as souvenirs with the competition logo or vou@@ chers for online shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of the 11 photos with the highest jur@@ y@@ valu@@ ations as well as competition participants , who took most of the objects and scored most points in the total score , were honored with the prizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other awards have been awarded by other organizations , which have joined the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the employees of the conservation park Holo@@ fer@@ i@@ v@@ sky@@ i , which is located in the metro@@ politan area Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in occupied park and submitted for competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there were also some special categories in national competition : &quot; Un@@ less Discovery , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habitats , an overview of the topics , the photos on Wikipedia , the best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Wiki@@ pedi@@ sts from 36 countries took part in the &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; photo competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best photos of natural monuments ( such as nature reserves , protected landscape areas , national parks and picturesque landscapes ) can be admired in a common gallery on Wik@@ im@@ edia Com@@ mons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizers and other collabor@@ ators have used h@@ ash@@ tag # Wiki@@ Lov@@ es@@ Earth to publish photos , and promote the willingness of sharing together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , they shared more than 13@@ 7@@ ,000 photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about one fifth of the participating countries come from Central and Eastern Europe , including Bulgaria , about whose national competition was reported in an earlier Global Vo@@ ices article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities should be exhausted , so that all technical possibilities should be exhausted and not give up . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website blocks to victims . @ An@@ hr@@ i , one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / .@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the blog he used to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was even the aim of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ggers , who is home to this blog as well , is still accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s lock and reflected what it meant for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that blogs are locked is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even if the locking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege state ; A arrest , an attempted murder , demonstration at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brave ones go the way to the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block@@ ade of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content , to which Egyptian users could have access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship , and who will it attack next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day newspapers are reporting in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers for their decision , explained the newspaper in such a way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a military force in a country that does not recognise the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editorial , the paper continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities by the police , who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the designation &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it uses ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist , Cec@@ ili@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , argue against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ sufficient neglect of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to commemor@@ ate , Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ ili@@ lia , according to statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders in each state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) and a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a decrease in violent death . for several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also results in serious consequences for people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an invisible point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war on or off , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime facing loyal troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative by the peace organization PA@@ X and the Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to the fact that local people were ordered locally or instructed by tunnels and check@@ points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food grown in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct project , MEP Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more &quot; becoming known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to provide 125 family knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started producing mushrooms from the regions , before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was accomplished , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , car@@ ton , etc . ) to produce new foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal , demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal during the week before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the forest from 15 to 16 October . this resulted in the government spending last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fires have also been registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions , which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery in 2017 alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burnt in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Des@@ p@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wide @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requ@@ est@@ ed@@ by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which permitted the construction activity if the applicant had means of self @-@ defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of lightly flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civilian protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants looking for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time , about the location and the spread of the fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was created in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was the deciding factor that the site counted more than half a million requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he took what was left of his modest wage and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than he himself , to earn his living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous crossing over the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day to aid needy people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , it is true that because of relatively high wins , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers are finding in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if they have officially made a request for asylum - which can still take months after the application of asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his irre@@ pres@@ sible habitat helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after doing various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was so good , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans are living in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament scrut@@ ini@@ zes a draft bill , which proposes that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of the law certificate , stating their full name and ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison sentence or the direction of a pen@@ al payment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which has been applied by sixty parliamentary members , is present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , a further MP filed a bill of law in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as the legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , it may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who captured Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators fighting against military coup promoted by President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years in detention , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until 20 May , because the prison leadership , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light from among other things gun ownership , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a held the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hears Tunisi@@ an activists in scre@@ ened documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours hearing Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , had expressly provided a controversial draft law to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine bin Ali of the corruption accused officials am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the nom@@ ination of his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to show their identification ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to new provisions of the inform@@ ational office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is supposed to be achieved . it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese networks have proposed in the social media to enforce these provisions only selective , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed its access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this designation is part of a law of 2014 , thanks to the Russian government exec@@ uting a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ Cont@@ acts and Od@@ n@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it was a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to encourage political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain cannot stop drinking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force the internet service provider to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
