&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my dear to America , is extraordinarily large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American writers and run their sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freely after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US was only strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in crowds for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number , the candidate nominated by the party ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ al@@ is@@ mus@@ Programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump &apos;s world outlook did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball , and we spent many hours watching Phoenix S@@ uns playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for her life and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still suits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were Andrew Tast@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared either racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as R@@ assi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arran@@ ging people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , most of which are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to look at a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . O@@ B . : as much as &quot; rebellion of the white against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; white in reference to the white and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ) as it called the Great Van Jones has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ di@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , his story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white Americas bears this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had an exchange of words with the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ tified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is now tr@@ ump land , said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this breaks my heart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar Mohammed is currently part of the IC@@ F@@ s Knight International Journ@@ alism Fel@@ lowship and a leader of the Code for Africa in Tanzania , a continental civilian technical and data journ@@ alism initiative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca , together with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music that lives with rub@@ b@@ ish
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra composed of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian &apos;s English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse and violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always smile and play in the hu@@ stle and play in the hu@@ stle and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually on the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed when Fa@@ vio showed something that he had never seen before , a violin made from waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill harmonic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the world produces about one billion tons of garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill harmonic follows the orchestra , with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orchestra , even before Pope Francis , played his music : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , the re@@ publication takes place for sharing content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before visiting Africa &apos;s other coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were , accordingly , anger@@ ed and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this type on their coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ oren , Mozambique and Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prime minister was suddenly surrounded by countries that simply refused everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries established by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deliberate dis@@ respect of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while campaigns against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and circul@@ ated by the s@@ nail , the information happened today in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the move to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating boats have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm who supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , losing the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fis@@ hers that inv@@ ade Eastern African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these illegal fishing fishermen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , actions include like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , stating fantasy names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; Come to me , &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole attempts to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . they discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has pursued and found escape ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system , which aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to detect suspi@@ cious ships more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and allows the position of every single track@@ able vessel to be displayed worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also sc@@ are them off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships that previously f@@ ished without license and had hardly had consequences , now know that they will be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets which are prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of creating more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia reported his first great triumph : in October , it launched Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a collaborative way of protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the resolution of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum in office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while gathered on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # la@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( such as : the suppression of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the sec@@ rec@@ y of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in her latest article : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where the inflation and rate of violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the torture day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was to continue the blocking of the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of the National Assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough , without sh@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to stop police forces including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic introduces the round that forms the amount of suppression per day : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dictatorship has suppressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim for a removal procedure , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ t@@ ek Media Lab@@ s :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , taking little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis from their point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took us so much , but also the fear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interview was translated into English , and is published with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano didn &apos;t choose his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father , he has suffered enough suffering from the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 he was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the gym to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the gym . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with an ERP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pass only that they will not escape one day , and I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , I would become secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought that would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , he pointed to an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over there , the prisoners are tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch which men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she looked like a bed , and metal feathers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable , and the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they frequently eng@@ ul@@ fed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch there in it was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized the smell immediately , and I realized that the smell of a body is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , how is it possible that a person can deal with another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wearing eye @-@ band@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused during the trial ) and took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ch quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were thrown into a pit , and were slain by soldiers , and buried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this , because my father told me about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero scored a man there , killing him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to survivors , the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was also accused of death by students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the path you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took approximately this route and then were tortured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting men and the disappearance of their bodies , in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges that you have fought against an enemy whom you fought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house , and steal everything in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , hit me , scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , we need no one else ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of back then , on whom I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I was there to testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops further , and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even so far , I went to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you did not say to people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could have put them into prison , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did these people not also have families , whom one could give up their mortal remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act , which one can do to a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course , something remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , I was even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought of showing my father was during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities , which I had to witness for his sake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt che@@ ated internally and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you were forced to join me as a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , I received the first ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me , that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally pron@@ ounce my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and sentenced to nine years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven of the 54 def@@ endants , originally , died during the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber , namely : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial site could be established that is now led by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witnesses of a very mis@@ fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word for the &quot; elderly motor@@ ist &quot; is wrong@@ ly translated - maybe even with malicious thank@@ sgiving &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area , and in the building itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing the original photo of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English translation was first removed . &quot; drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; ) was replaced later by the adequate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers . &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blo@@ gger reported , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are truly sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan , and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who have been involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the release of the article published on Yahoo , the not @-@ called re@@ porter revealed comments on the light showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ ap up against older drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error was , among other things , the following comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How fla@@ wed is the translation actually not , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively small number of native speakers studying Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations into the company internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is also widely used , often with funny results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the verb@@ s and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation show that this technique cannot substitute a human translator for a long time , and this is especially true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless , but from big companies or by government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will use a more serious source for its translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and on television
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also wore footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , opposing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cut and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , Internet websites are re @-@ locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant in the coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ om@@ munic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing , that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to broadcast again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government is becoming increasingly difficult to access multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by the architectural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before her graduation from university , she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house proudly saying about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for her family . Cri@@ adi@@ ta is called Cri@@ adi@@ ta in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her minor son or her minor daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof above the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do house@@ work for many days that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , is generally not silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family which their daughter believes in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and whose exploitation with the faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not get any training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , they never know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ rowing in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was a former military member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo who worked as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt ( Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra came to Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the young girl &apos;s life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go bl@@ amed deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies , requiring that there was &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions both boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the married couple , and almost 60 civil society organisations , demanded a rapid investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be pointing to direction - if the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers had to work now , and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all went to school , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that her even had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning , preparing breakfast for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but got no unlimited food either . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house than eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ e@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read leading articles from opposition newspapers such as Sen@@ der@@ o or El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to have no faith given to the official media reports on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which is almost never talked about are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realise that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school , or in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly clearly felt that I belonged to no group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small Dan@@ tin for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for learning .
please log in .
starting starting Monday if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the state , who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the author displayed again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I found one . I check if it works with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery and cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ay@@ an and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors who had to pay tribute to them and to give them tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that for displaying power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up which is assigned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it failed to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a financial penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft law , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and is cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video coaching and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced if it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are currently unable to register the registration on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Pat@@ rons of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , it is not known until now that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to feed them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Parliament member , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty was to threaten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; insti@@ gate protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Kurdish natural environ@@ ment@@ ress , the Persian Leop@@ ard secured Iraq &apos;s war in Iraq &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq work the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization of Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about showing another side of her country , which is not just war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs by Nature Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to protecting wildlife zones in the region of Kur@@ dist@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his works have been published in numerous international publications including the TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2009 to 2014 Meyer lived in the Nor@@ di@@ ra@@ k , where he founded the first Iraqi photo agency with Metro@@ graphy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , the progress made for the northeast of Japan was the progress made in the last six years to revi@@ ve the lives of those affected by the triple catastrophe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a vivid pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast which had both experienced the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring banks of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still experienced a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the detailed report of the paper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( which is said to be completed ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation shel@@ ters ( which is ev@@ acu@@ ated by dis@@ ev@@ ements in the villages , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still ende@@ aring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated homes were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 1,@@ 100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered large @-@ scale damage in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent again , as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to earn their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its issue of commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also increased its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not just witnessed the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were transferred to permanent replacement homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 2017 state , 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are older than 50 years old . they have to be avoided because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one meets people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is finally very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia last Friday . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures last Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated him this Saturday , and now transferred it to an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o , and the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás declared that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he struck Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a video of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers rush to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( around 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ me@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : in this case the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he had joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . this was where the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who was hit by a police officer .
police gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the Brazilian media del@@ etes street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protag@@ onist : a window screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window , to illustrate their titles in illustr@@ ative fashion with a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also be recognised , if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by the head@@ lines entitled &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cuba &apos;s forgotten villages , forgotten by the de@@ activation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folk community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ am , is generally known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the framework of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stops every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry already imp@@ acted the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion , not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially written documents which differ@@ ed only concerning the parts removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of them were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could have approved any withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane fabri@@ c@@ ates that was still in operation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most sophisticated industrial area of Cuba , and the most important working lat@@ op , has been extingu@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to employment and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know whether during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years , the popular community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich became acquainted with many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to mut@@ ate , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road and also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the prospect of the future , many young people left the region at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created which serves not even for the supply of the municipality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for forty @-@ nine months , the old soldier brought a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops will bring mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus increases that young participants in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever they can find in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Sam@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia talks for example the history of Highway 16 , including &apos; Highway of tears &apos; , a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , cases were not solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngsters involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , there is also a translation into English , translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I will continue my days on Earth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will take our cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we as youth have lost our way in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise some@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a poor life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can grow and move forward to our youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can do what the Creator has appointed for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also add and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( for the rest of the day ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which is served in the restaurant &quot; Plastic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers see themselves these plastic courts , and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an entire industry , dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are numerous small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more . however , they are becoming a new trend today in show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now in special sale : new mobile bands decorated with plastic courts as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ es@@ y gathering objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new boom in the food production is becoming increasingly more complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this part , too , we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here is an apple , which keeps your mobile phone : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ intern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with Lach@@ s@@ rogen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;ll be the only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # , for the ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video will give you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the gri@@ eving or the par@@ ishes who have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) and tells stories of people who have been involved in the fight between the law enforcement agencies and car@@ tels .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime is not just for us to fear our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as much as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives , &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who scans secret tom@@ bs after his son each weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store at El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what kind it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I pass on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the titles of titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the perpetrators when they go through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , that is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , when stories are mere numbers in a stati@@ stic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ genu@@ ity of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and are still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four month black@@ mail in the capital district : &quot; how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminal month paid money from her business until she destroyed not only the business but also torn her family apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only contact , if it is absolutely necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these horrible days , whether wines would dissolve my deep rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it , to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg , one for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life is made of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men by a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings based on data from the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and Government of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he links contains images on which violence is depicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this false link between image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images of news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , covering dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby which was full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses burned , and the cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people were burned to obsc@@ urity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users , My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows rows of fo@@ aled bodies , which are lined up on the floor while people watch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but here , history does not end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , the same photograph has been edited several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eye witnesses reported drastically about atro@@ cities , before which they had to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses and shops were burned down , and bodies were found in streets and bushes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were dis@@ car@@ ded , shot or burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the help of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in context to provide arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the p@@ ong image also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Brotherhood in Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some caused by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi message that was fal@@ si@@ fied in 2012 , the president of Myanmar allegedly said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image taken from the DR Congo to capture this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global reach of false data
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these false coupl@@ ings go back to 2011 and 2012 , and are actually coming from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far more information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 images ( status dated May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the projected image from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixing mask of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have forwarded false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of the frau@@ dul@@ ent use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some cases , which can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country studies of wrong coupling of the image from the DR Congo , with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available on Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement was rejected by a Greek fact check page in 2013 , and again in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nigeria in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even within Nigeria , the DR Congo photo was shared as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Malaysia in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that pursu@@ es sympathy to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , as the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Myanmar in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a report on what they came to as &quot; deliberately mis@@ gi@@ fted news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lev@@ elling , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message was fal@@ sely alleged that the President of Myanmar had declared his 2012 president , that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story along with the image of S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication , the picture continues to be included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the picture later put into circulation with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image of the DR Congo showed up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were attracting greater attention to these events , which really took place in the name of Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message , supposedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the ho@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Embassy in which the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ inet mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally , they possess image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original tragedy of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ ming ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims , or to the defense of Muslims - the murdered of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued , compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are countless people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests this mood of false and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution of violent images has already been discussed extensively ( here , for example ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that retention of images of a refusal equ@@ ates to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investigated how violent media work to help others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is much to be discussed about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but can be used diver@@ sely from context or mis@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , every examination of incorrect attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ translated ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or even impossible to translate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these un@@ translated words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all resist , stub@@ born to every attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand precisely what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , whereas the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ Trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu language , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Make sure your parents are in recognition of what they have done in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they resol@@ ute other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of this &quot; confusing &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I have managed to add the area of raff@@ le Japan to my portfolio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just published a video interview with the street photographer Lee Chap@@ man , Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Chap@@ mans &apos;s blog and portfolio , his photographs are on his Tokyo Times Inst@@ agra@@ m and Twitter accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ fill disaster in this decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya sank into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a response from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people were missed because of the floods and slu@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rainf@@ all occurred on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle is also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are scheduled for the transport of emergency deliveries for the residents trapped in their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also established , too , to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation , humanitarian aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taxi Call app Pick@@ up ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the disaster centre is informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring inhabitants in need in security and provide remedi@@ al measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now a long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next channel , we channel rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , aren &apos;t they ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already conducted this conversation , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar@@ an , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has developed in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had to dis@@ courage me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide , there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we do not look at all equally .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow , we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , the same as I do not fit in there , are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the need to be dis@@ car@@ ti@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what pictures come to mind , when you think of him ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this extinction is a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another exists in the fic@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , the western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these images still stand out today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , defective nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even vote for its first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their scar@@ f in public buildings , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought home with slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children will become the target of anti @-@ viral attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we relate to them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to reach the 1.7 billion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves , which help us to understand the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the accounts of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my im@@ migrant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ plac@@ eable Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now a must @-@ have , Muslim and American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of catching my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sh@@ ar , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we relate , Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s scar@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its most ugly forms , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is attacking our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot possibly fit into a drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born as a Muslim but I was born to me in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of them , I repeat three times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

use has been approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to me is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with her sisters , how they win a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a Muslim means to speak the prayers she had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a people that has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which a company has created with the name of A@@ ven@@ erable British India Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my own grandfather we@@ eps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried to the family of K@@ ash@@ mir , who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have torn apart the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been colon@@ ised all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history , before a century , was jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed by a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there were planes , he travelled in more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ fulfilled history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across each continent , went into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the U.S. and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave with the name Bil@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , and a journalist mean the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; they . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building up structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regi@@ ments , which began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just those countries , who are bombar@@ ding it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we dis@@ assemble to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically sound picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversations we have to lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous expressions that we engage in our news editorial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Muslim Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , a Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason for the fact that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet been given them ; now , they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today a missing Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things , which I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where one is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are not the terms which we usually take in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; have been scientist Stan@@ ford himself four decades ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously , as my girlfriend and I have a new future in which we don &apos;t have a president who bu@@ ys chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story telling , by Flickr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a possibility to connect here , and now , despite a language barrier with someone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported about another initiative of Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honor the language diversity of large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin exist in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been organizing events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fe@@ ar these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , historians tell their story in their own language first and then translate or explain it in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience is involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona in Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to extend this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ fixing state debt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 3 , 2017 several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was called by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural check of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico are calling for the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts to be accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to find a decrease in pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island , not in the territory of the United States , is suffering from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a Non @-@ profit Non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will risk the citizens &apos; participation and conviction without being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night guard for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continued the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling produced books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Liberty : collective Refle@@ ction ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book published last year and is available roy@@ alty free , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , it means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side to side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make sense from our various experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about his present state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , what have we given up from times of extreme convi@@ ctions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , began to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bodied not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I call his name , I am overwhelmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el opened the door to technology , he taught me to use both computers and smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ ment which she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was detained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .

the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens every time you visit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I sink in the world of your charming eyes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I go into every detail of your voice , and words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I carry with passion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your eyes say goodbye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bring back all the moments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bear witness to myself , that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year passes , my soul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while at the same time
I am in your cage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are still in the cage of the monsters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested or subjected to violence by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for release of Bass@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : due to corruption , director after release of prison again on previous post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case , where a member after half of his prison sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants ( around 800 000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money stem@@ med from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who claimed the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not conduct disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many inhabitants do not call this action well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , Centr@@ o de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to recru@@ it the Director : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency , and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that even the company should have led a disciplinary procedure against the acc@@ user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company apparently remained silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resist@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had subsi@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could give lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ref@@ und@@ able !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any moral : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted so massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to come back and to serve the State , but has had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but has only served itself in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as a source of in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ine Ze@@ ú@@ s prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely con@@ notation con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself doesn &apos;t automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that Po@@ sts , in whom they discussed the use of the word or doubt , have been cens@@ ored for its use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are multiple Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example it is written in &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) or &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( Cur@@ tain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post of one of my friends was wi@@ ped today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; curing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an , resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before releasing all the po@@ sts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write on Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should do instead is carefully analy@@ sing the post , checking it by checking the next words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine ( stool ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading the hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all those who hate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts when he merely wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I was informed of this new policy from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from copying , post and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; stools &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had , it would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no h@@ ote language but were removed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese Text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry , and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to get the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control , critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the pedi@@ atri@@ cian
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ rich age now lies at 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , a contractual partner of the UN child &apos;s Convention on Child Rights , defined the min@@ ors as &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , stri@@ ved to aboli@@ sh laws on the children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should think about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this rather un@@ complicated matter , and some doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in early 2017 the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree , and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s to@@ e was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one decided against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it was decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who suffers a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and that &apos;s worth nearly every price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel Jackson thought that it took me long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the age @-@ rich age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft for the amendment to the marriage law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of whom were present at the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs voted against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is no longer allowed by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Co@@ al Par@@ rot shiel@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many thanks to all the activists , who fought him out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
congratulations .
thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to bring his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ator of the law said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to address the issue differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the problem we would like to talk about the state in our bedrooms , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think it &apos;s not about a problem ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws they fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor shared Y@@ ar@@ news &apos;s local news service that they were h@@ acked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by using web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright law in the USA , international dark@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series reb@@ elled against the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many technically vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently featured in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform depen@@ ded on all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator @-@ machine @-@ connections ) which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only a screen@@ shot and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror an open source project that anyone can use to host similar bul@@ war@@ ms when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one attacks another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essentially , the server continues the request for the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that motivated him to wear a camera , and try to gra@@ vit@@ alize the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described on Facebook , how this first class situation helps him with his work : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just rested at home when suddenly called me Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , who received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately , I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to gn@@ ash images ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S@@ ag@@ ar aims to collaborate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he has already risen from face to face to tig@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b itself from the view of the sheep , not when sleeping ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late in the evening , the light is too weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bus appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see some of these photos below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , a revised version has been re @-@ published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , women avoid to address the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences should they neglect the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and community after having appealed to a married family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far less cour@@ agements to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , entered into a unique club and thus quickly became the main protag@@ onist of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and at the same time made them the am@@ bass@@ adors of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini in their discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not speaking lou@@ dly the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all maintain liability and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never thought about it until this discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to engage the discussion with an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy that she conf@@ essed only before herself during the whole exercise , while another decided to let the whole fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still in adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put the women into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation turned into violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ c@@ amber dot on the forehead that indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ c@@ amber point if he did it either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just laugh@@ ed , and I stopped wearing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely stopped working , but think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they seem to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of choice of dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , we have made only small steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tasted it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and are not members of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Z@@ inno@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from excluded groups in India , making videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; News of those who experience it themselves , &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative tag
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 29 this year the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese t@@ witter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the turn of the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was inter@@ viewed by Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of his first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here realized quite quickly , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

uns@@ killed men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , warned the population that men of the country could be attacked by attacks in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the Organ@@ izer , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a member of a family of men may reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the BBC &apos;s police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that successive attacks on GM men were registered , in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the aim of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this led to the fact that the UN 2016 , in the South African country , conducted a mission to examine this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and murder of single headed individuals for the production and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ba , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger poor S@@ na@@ ï@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we mo@@ urn for him and feel our deepest con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were herself as insi@@ der of the Assad government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown , when N@@ our@@ a was told by Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre is the honour of an open web movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been in use for his release over the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 and the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; innumerable of those who were arrested by the regime or disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; sub@@ version . &quot; after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China describes Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and he tells a nar@@ r@@ ator , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , China still maintains calls from the international community to release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or enable him to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations united nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to give Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , since exports had largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his detention , he was unable to accept his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as it announced in an explanation on June 30 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the Americans &quot; wish for him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Bethel Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy asked for a fur@@ ious response from China , with the expression of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , based on the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Li@@ u receives all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 7 and 8 , Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to previous diplomatic sources in Beijing , Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide li@@ u with adequate health care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s foreign ministry called for China in an explanation on 29 June , to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where it needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually pick it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China urged China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June in Li@@ u and that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been rigor@@ ously punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question may appear sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at the international level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s single political party because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports , that Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , and most people make a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very class@@ y : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other &quot; normal countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently led by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , since they are better suited to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam provided answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he clo@@ aked the relevant questions , with non @-@ answers of rational nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s testimony , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the head@@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy@@ ous speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore perform their military service , do they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are we the citizens of a city , or the inhabitants of a city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one ever said , Singapore is a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question addressed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; replied I . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my clarification usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Canadian differs from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack , when they are traveling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans , on the other hand ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their bags , to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a free health care system !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , there are no weapons ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
same sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , we say very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not like these guys , just south of the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wouldn &apos;t make me so successful , for example , to mix with Johnny from Dallas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Adam from San Francisco , California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are , however , some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first : being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be fun - just like good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being harmless is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and pay no attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from things happening around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even so far , I would go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video from a pop band par@@ o@@ ys Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pop band that is famous in Thailand has published a music video that par@@ odi@@ zes the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially in relation to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives an absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; adjustment change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals seen as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict end against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two days later , it came to a put@@ sch of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long jail sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut &quot; tribute by Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost cities in eastern Australia

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ war society re@@ covers only very slowly in East Asia Min@@ or , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Asia Min@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , demo@@ cra@@ ans , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , mainly Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such settlements , in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , are also called ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely having climbed over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ storey dwelling blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , which are called K@@ hr@@ u@@ zh@@ kov , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts talking , and it is hard for him to stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ kov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where clothes are dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother forbi@@ ds us to let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbi@@ d us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend , and suddenly she abandoned the ruined building and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ el@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not abandon Asia Min@@ or to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial help from her daughter , insi@@ sting she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when holidays are , we visit ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist , Nat@@ ascha , lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , it reminds of the village life before the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently we bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each child , Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , ste@@ els and chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy runs past us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , a group of children persec@@ ute the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while they are walking , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure authenticity in their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t know it differently .

photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossing migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign@@ post to the hotel , but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants coming here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is rather quiet at present , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ão , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sebasti@@ ão family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebasti@@ en travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to regain her husband and the three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months , selling SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wonder if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they left to greet them or tell her about the course of their journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains , that their Christian faith is the drive of their work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , while other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press him money without having a plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him its roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corri@@ dors , the travelers consult their teleph@@ ones quietly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with lots of photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens she made her an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she laughs sad while she imag@@ ines her short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se Fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; it repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by t@@ witter users , let us know what else to expect ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in Western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities must also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the app would determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this app with the Fil@@ ters for min@@ ors is intended to help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an app with these features can , of course , be used in many ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from In China , &quot; published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the inhabitants randomly , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by wa@@ xing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description provided that the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Reg@@ ulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the statements of the City Council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government departments , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also noted these new monitoring methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published its &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable disks , lap@@ tops and media memory cards &quot; by the local police on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those which refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both inside and outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one , which makes all honour to their name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who has cast down in a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow metaph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look behind the scenes and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is moving on the axis of the disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proved his power over us , destroying even the simplest concepts we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five te@@ ens were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night , with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the districts sought after , only my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time even if I had no high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit , after the power supply stopped functioning in the quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a glorious picture that filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up his mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you back your voice back to the office of security service from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sorry about seeing me in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I did , did nothing to do with courage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest chat that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word about what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this day , the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the courtyard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am presenting all the details exactly , before I enter the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and must immediately put me in without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the function@@ ary left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old proven method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my C@@ elle comra@@ de was a first @-@ first @-@ hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after some hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps it was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him , if I remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have loved a bird of birds to drive away all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ elled in the fruits of my head &apos;s garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear them cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries out , every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ation on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they spoke in the Alban@@ ian dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that relieve him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start to join this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and how this happened , it was un@@ important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in punishment , in all their diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cries didn &apos;t hurt him enough , why they exchanged the tube with a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator used to work as a waste collector or whether this belonged to normal working equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four wires , to present us the magnificent invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any emotion in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er observed the cooling down and didn &apos;t really like it , which is why he picked up next to an electrically charged rod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electricity flowing through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my half @-@ naked body , lying stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared , and the pain was there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , this was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me like a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they always kept me free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ lls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his mouth @-@ stained lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lives in the top floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and ra@@ p music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music that often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who has no limits in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special tendency against US foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian P@@ oultry of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Jord@@ anian law also states that food consumption is illegal during Ram@@ adan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with a protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically speaking , the mu@@ gs speak lou@@ dly hot coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open air , especially if one throws a glance into neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ers , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; Just &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the tried @-@ and @-@ trusted legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continue to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement might not be simply sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those , whom they should actually trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honorary murder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteer kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan is still lacking in order to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be detained in@@ definitely and for their release often years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but cle@@ ars that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs , which are political at the core , can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself quite often : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want - either faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were highly cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later realize that his comments were torn from context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly tou@@ red the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ whatsoever , who later worked on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why could Jord@@ an@@ ier not do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former governmental representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they were critical to the problems associated with deep @-@ rooted corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now rep@@ elled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in succession , but the way of progress - it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will engage in real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will move forward and consequently resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Centre on Crisis Reporting , a member of the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori , one of the three biggest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the cab@@ ar@@ ers who march dr@@ um@@ mers and dances over more than a thousand years have come to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to the E@@ mis@@ hi .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ tl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I look forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two cars are just to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seldom , outward appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ bery and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2017 , a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , appearance and also the original hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens move into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can replic@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are experts competing against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy School , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity for young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dresser &apos;s art which enables them to find work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently fashionable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters

use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article will be published here , as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ou@@ tri@@ ght , affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into their lives as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now accommodate them and support them in setting up a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , which should then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation letters arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people whom we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and want to build a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 , 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they did before , in order to counter@@ act the commands of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and said , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , I was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered for a discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear these people who had never heard before and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I often saw as monsters and even hated people who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it encourages me that all people - including those killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian people have been prophes@@ ied , that after the dis@@ armament peace would reign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms and protest for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , to a policy without arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will have many difficulties ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova , whose first publication took place on the website OC Media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , like a women &apos;s sword , hasn &apos;t come up overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , shared with us some of her experiences and talked to us about what is happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sexual equality of her country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of fear for her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day , I was told that someone needed my help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost consciousness , and again woke up in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , some women had got everything along and started scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two tears in my right lung wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : in which cases were you placed , in which of the men or the women ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him , that he has been respect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February , I received threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of an alpine mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they presented absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to say that I didn &apos;t change my gender in the official television that everything was just bad speech and Phot@@ oshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother got too much , and she laid a rope around her neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate was on top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought her without registering me , with no badge , without everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke my old SIM card , and threw it into the tr@@ ash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to invo@@ ke my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our people already know in which hotel you are in , you know even your room number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements , I still carry in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I actually trouble watching the person remembering her from her past - so to my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , I mean , they are likely to charge their relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; is experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me , there are not many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are arrested there so that they can be presented later as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but immersed in a targeted way in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was detained for one and a half months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says many people had disappeared in this prison , after having grown beard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there has been nothing new from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they just took it along .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits so far there were no reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known already in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ernst &apos;s case !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was true , I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is it possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched , I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wearing tu@@ bular jeans and short tops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria never touched me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often say it to children , when they make fun of sick people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so , they closed their eyes before you , because they believed that you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased me nor beaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , you could sense how people began to change in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at first , looked at you with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : what activity do you work now , right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , I still work as a activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people , when I picked up some of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a Muslim , and I want to help those who need help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make white foam in front of the mouth , that there are no sw@@ ow@@ ls with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have those who have cab@@ ard@@ ines , which the Russians have , but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan , live together with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know , many think about tran@@ identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion , to be precise , different life settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not feel ashamed for my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not , whether I have a partner or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not sad at all , therefore - I just know that I am now myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 revised the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child , lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video shared on YouTube held the moments , after he had kind@@ led himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that several others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families , and to pursue a safe work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the native population only gets little of that wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government also built a large number of trun@@ ks to diver@@ t water from Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have led only to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate , among the Arab A@@ haw@@ ks , rose to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is concluded that primary school completed , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % completed university graduation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to this , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is the reason for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as function@@ aries and institutions do not favour Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their ancest@@ ral ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace can &apos;t be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up , taking note of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays despite the same education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they can do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women is a global epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still trans@@ vers@@ ed across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of this , I know and know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I suffer double , triple among them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet : when I speak on skin color , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention in which way we have always been subjected to racial separation and discrimination , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or about it , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of violence , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men in all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect as a black woman , which refuses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her mind , which refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ n compla@@ ined : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to promote their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I prefer to release myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism , calling me to engage in the movement of femin@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in this way , in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman , I become a part of this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither excessive nor ignored , nor denied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the region of Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques that help oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; The crying women &quot; in order to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region , and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of the architectural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Ref@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the informed ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women pay an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State Department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence can contact the prosecution authorities at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; content 1 Be@@ ats and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ay@@ ah laws : good approach , inadequate implementation of strokes and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , research scientist on gender issues at Centr@@ o de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General posted 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in peace courses . here too 86 % of women &apos;s ads came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically mal@@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of mental mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of mental abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an independent crime , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no imp@@ unity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo of Jes@@ sie Ins@@ bru@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ ments and a legal system , which does not under@@ mine anything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but she still gave up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer collabor@@ ated with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women would happen to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mal@@ treatment of Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people responded to their contributions , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever had lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen away from Carlos so long , and did not leave him earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not born in Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Vic@@ tori@@ a case , everything started with psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ scrut@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign , supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain and punish Fem@@ izi@@ d for an independent crime continu@@ ance , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the law text was changed in some ways in order to prevent de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are banned in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill had fores@@ een the bulk of ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to pay an ad and would like to receive a secure housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ human relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reimbur@@ se as long an ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack its victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of the architectural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Ref@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman , independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper continues to be attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the newspaper editors , is still in prison , serving a prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were also arrested and brought to justice later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after having passed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chief of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rule of the Sul@@ t@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , to restrict public freedom , including freedom of human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 reports about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces arrested I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court of Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in an inheritance case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the board of editors , was invited by the ISS before the special department and detained by the security forces at his arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information gave the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and also ordered the final closing of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of breach of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3@@ 800 US dollars each . moreover , a one @-@ year ban on vocational training was imposed on the two journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after having found the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was set in the amount of £ 5,000 ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 in front of the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i said that at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to return Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Solomon government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; closure was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended three additional months and with which the Minister presented another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow publication of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media , it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : for a lack of healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to study these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : what do you think is the major current scientific topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the 1980s , Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of sal@@ ts he can get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as crop breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security around the future of food production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the United States and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source , breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and ate red skir@@ ts of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement is from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed it , and not immediately eliminate them - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the discrimin@@ ating professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to it , seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to continue to grant their seed freely available to others , in contrast to patents and plant traits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is continuously shr@@ inking because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights that are becoming increasingly available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it even more difficult for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass planted plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of Visi@@ bility
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those by which their flavor or color improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is due to more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if one has to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time , nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants make them themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how plants do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farm@@ ste@@ ads and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation , are required to produce masses of her@@ bi@@ cides , who breed in their varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just in a hurry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who are active in international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the pattern or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the independent plant breeders , Frank Mor@@ ton , looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Mor@@ ton believes that breeders through avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds , and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , announced that conventional plants should not be patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from whole East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend for seed patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Douglas , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled for the next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon realize it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the eleven best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth , &quot; which focuses on nature monuments and nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award ceremony took place in the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev on October 7 , 2017 , in which the winning photos were presented in an exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the month of May , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 pictures with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 motifs on natural heritage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a thousand of these pictures are already used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all winners received certificates as a reminder and other prizes , such as souvenirs with competitive logo or vou@@ chers for online shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest j@@ uries and competition participants , who photographed most of the objects and scored most points in the total score , were honored with the prizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other awards have been awarded by other organizations , which have joined the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the employees of the conservation park Holo@@ fer@@ i@@ v@@ sky@@ i , which is situated in the metro@@ politan area Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in occupied park and submitted for competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there were also some special categories in national competition : &quot; un@@ ic@@ e@@ Discovery &quot; initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the topics , the photos on Wikipedia are missing best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best photos of natural monuments ( such as nature reserves , protected landscape areas , national parks and picturesque landscapes ) can be admired in a common gallery on Wik@@ im@@ edia Com@@ mons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizers and other collabor@@ ators have used h@@ ash@@ tag # Wiki@@ Lov@@ es@@ Earth to publish photos , and promote the willingness of sharing together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , they shared a total of over 13@@ 7@@ ,000 photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals , it has never been as important as it is now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog , which he addressed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ggers , who is home to this blog , is also accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s lock and reflected what it meant for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that blogs are locked is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be meaningful for the world , it is for two reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege state ; A arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brave ones go the way to the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s was offering began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking , blocking , and filtering access to the Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship , and whom will it attack next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day newspapers are reporting in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , published the Editorial article on 16 August , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers for their decision , explained the newspaper in such a way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . all , but what happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a military force in a country that does not recognize the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist said that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used , cru@@ el@@ ty of the police , who first shoots and then asks questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the designation &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ili@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ sufficient neglect of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to commemor@@ ate , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ ili@@ lia , according to the statistics of 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the moral rates per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ ili@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by employing a massive police force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for some years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not the basis for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also results in serious consequences for people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an invisible point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war on or off , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sales@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative by the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ u@@ ated by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led to the fact that local people had to rely locally or instructed by tunnels and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is gaining popularity more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to teach 125 families to cultivate mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise donations to Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushroom @-@ derived fung@@ al seeds , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was accomplished , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , car@@ ton , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people were prot@@ esting in many districts in Portugal on October 21 , demanding justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions , which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery in 2017 alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burnt in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Des@@ p@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ eign@@ ty of the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requ@@ est@@ ed@@ by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which permitted construction activity if the applicant had means of self @-@ defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of lightly flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Portuguese Civil Guard on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants looking for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data with the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was created in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so critical about this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the site counted more than half a million requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 1994 , the invasion of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war had broken out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n faction that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though his mother did not say it that way , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the boy was to burst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the tu@@ gs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ bollah and Hez@@ bollah , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt fear@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he took what was left of his modest salary , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks of mort@@ ars who were harder than he himself to earn his living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and remained on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , it is true that due to relatively high grants , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers can find in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his un@@ restrained age of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after doing various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af concentrated its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was so good , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis succ@@ es@@ ful history is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my land , and I can &apos;t live happily , when I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society , and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also planning plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of the legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison sentence or the direction of a pen@@ al payment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which has been adverti@@ sed by sixty parliamentary members , is present to the legislative and constitutional committee and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , a further MP filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as the legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against military coup that led to the resolution of President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ors who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in custody for a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison line of human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light from among other things , possession of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another case , a criminal court ordered the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists to scre@@ ened documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may , Tunisi@@ an authorities have spent six hours hearing Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , provided a controversial draft of the bill to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine bin Ali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the Bill of Law look like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which grants journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the district court in Tunis on the 9th of May as a witness in the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to show their ID ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to new rules of the inform@@ ational office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that registration with full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached in conversations within social networks . it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these provisions only selective , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government exec@@ uting a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ n@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source working together with groups in order to secure a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
