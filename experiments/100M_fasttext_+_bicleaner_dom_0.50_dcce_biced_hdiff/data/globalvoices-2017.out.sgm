<seg id="2665">"" "" "" "often, these instructions help others to get the same result with another method." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if one has to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have time, money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "" "" "" "</seg>
