that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before anyone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they are revealing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government cli@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to cracks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide themselves less and less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of split@@ ting and split@@ ting , they could do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his phone calls secret , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as his email data , finance and bank information , his credit meeting , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ gger went to a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive because the government has more and more ways to pick up everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology permits to b@@ ypass re@@ porters &apos; rights , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today there is communication software that has not yet existed , as cracks in his book had written , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Code , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site like that of the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like in any ordinary contact form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective message agency has access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government can no longer obtain information , and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Code is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology scientists , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a chance to bring out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the next environmental representative , who wants to report an alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect all of our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and Mi@@ ghty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , has tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous , waiting for the next release , and the documents unveiled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should that happen to us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and hide their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people are very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always imagine like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ oot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it interesting , too , that there are less reports on this matter in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans , who were in this Dis@@ closure , this scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , there is less information in some US states to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
che@@ aters are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all except a lawyer made suggestions for how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody got money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may sound absurd as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing has ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen sur@@ passes to greater transparency , as regards the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 , in Northern Ireland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU is in central registers at a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States la@@ gged behind here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have made a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing , watching my things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city , making a road trip across the country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in a Maz@@ da trunk ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking on to@@ e @-@ tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the work of art he bought from me hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my first experience as a host , and it has completely changed my perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a jump , two years later ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them all through the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time , and pay our rent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things got rolling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to find out , if we could make a business concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when we visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay overnight with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , they are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as children , we all learned that strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , you are thinking about things that you can do well . we could design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design afford something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree of trust we wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
type your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat neighbour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quiet touch of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel , when they open the door first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , most guests feel like sleeping somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , our company can exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could you tell Twitter , that he is chann@@ eled for the president &apos;s office ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name , if he had told him how his dog or his children were told ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine you could have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a well thought @-@ out feedback system , trust is crucial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , we made some things wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had left their assessments before we put them online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are to age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting when adding the reputation of a person -- in our case , by app@@ rais@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good reputation stands out in common ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , we learned that trust depen@@ ded on how much you get out of yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your home ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you create it with design , to make this degree of openness ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text , and we also give tips on which subjects to write something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to refu@@ te these prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , you see how many people claim our offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third , a need not covered before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the business is going very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were guests who illeg@@ ally celebrated parties , or devast@@ ated apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the project , I participated in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood on the front line , when confidence was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts , if I only think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , from the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction had ever been a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for people are familiar with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when trust works , miracles can arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of our guests had a holiday in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to have a heart attack due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save life , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let one stay longer , without calculating the extra nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , not every stay starts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simple to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lease &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people place a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what would be if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be if in any place you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thorough and show a neighborhood where you have never heard of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would that look like ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be , if cities would accept the idea of common sharing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now residents were offered . students , who were looking for a stay , were offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were moved out , and incu@@ b@@ ator programs started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 19@@ 1 countries will be hosted by strangers or even hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was hospitality , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar sites before us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , why did our work ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing !
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Maz@@ da passes by me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we could use for design in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you think , when you look at me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or suppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or just a delay at the airport security check .
this is true indeed .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the media represent people who look like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that Americans think , most of them do not know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted .
a car@@ ag@@ ul@@ er fitness fan@@ atic in
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ te me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you suppression yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only passi@@ vely accepted the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ t@@ ful , and ultimately thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was trust and slow surrender , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked down on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people jumped from the buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such things ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u related the deeds of others from a citizen to a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I was sil@@ ently -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ep in well lighted areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people whom it was for Muslims to open up and beat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really burn attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been angry with the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine ! I was angry , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not easy to explain yourself continually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about my church , like a tumor in the body of the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant , or ben@@ ign ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there may be a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant attitude towards other people , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen off of faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people going to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would put ourselves in their minds , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology grounds on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is their brut@@ ality , which lets them read these things into Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl came to him , because she would have preferred to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised to solve a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Ima@@ m re @-@ establishes the connection with God and its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what she learned in the mosque , she retained her to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accept rather an authorit@@ arian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study shows that when individuals submit messages that have been neg@@ atively reported by Muslims , they vo@@ cally agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you see when the mood sw@@ aps up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happened in advance of the Iraq war , and during two electoral periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us to all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when referring to collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was talented in the dental faculty , talented and promising ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man whom she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fired on De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did we go to the mosque , or did we stay at home safely ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spoke it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America would like to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently with high pressure to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , pulled my boots , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there , because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to play it safe ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are better than that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wonder what to say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind with deep step , working in a class@@ y mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , I am as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , in any way , I am an exception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before air parcel delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by connecting , flying devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can also build up self @-@ winding structures , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we would like to show you some of our new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility within the autonomous flight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear star@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flying machine , trying to beat two flies with a flap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in reverse flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimum position is , and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gather together to hurt you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remotely controlled flying equipment that had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote control unit . it was invented recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross rods , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it does not have the sophisticated algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to t@@ oss it right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to throw it right , if everybody watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Moon is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see , that it is symmet@@ rical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s look at that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
it turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , even if restricted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this , by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every unit knows where it is in space , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine will want a flying lamp screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for types like us , the wage is in development and act of creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a gal@@ axy far away gal@@ axy cir@@ cl@@ ed two black holes each other more and more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they did not use their energy in the form of light -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first place , we categ@@ ori@@ ze events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing on us -- even the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of them stopped crazy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be greatly increased , which improved the recognition performance enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced lig@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes broke through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went through you , me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observations for 23 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a col@@ lation in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ acked into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to illustrate this , lec@@ turers often conduct a really al@@ ber@@ ly dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and qu@@ en@@ ched at the meeting of the waves . the expansion of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nuclear nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott says , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in notes , this is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the face of your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; dip Bob . &quot;
same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with them , we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to the gravity , we can tell about a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ p simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a kind of movement of motion , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Som@@ o hears the following : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as quickly as the bars of your mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think briefly what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we know of it , because we have heard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , the permanent importance of Lig@@ o is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as never before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this way , we can listen to the All and hear the invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae are explo@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very useful . from them , we learned a lot about the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes take place in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never see , as these are op@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the old but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own tail light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that things exist that we have never seen before , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , as Lig@@ o observed them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the suction bones for our arch@@ eological work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the birth of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I start playing the show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear of holding speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is called &quot; E@@ stim@@ ate , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there , I swear to always play with them whenever you appeal to me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like , stir up life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perfect job .
no .
I am a Titan .
perfect job .
I ro@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program into the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every shipment has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new episode all nine days , four television programs , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which simultaneously are in production four , 16 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America , my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created and not just produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perfect job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard to run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I say I understand that I don &apos;t just dream about a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I go into work , there is no other feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a portrait of a high tone , run a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is such a change in me , when work is going well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people assume that when I explain to them the sums , I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not understand me wrong , it does it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sums -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum@@ ming is action and activity , and the sum is a drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ zz is music , the sum@@ ming is light and air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire to size differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feeling of not being able to do anything differently , as to asp@@ ire to size no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not ready for failure , and I only know that I love sum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make one clear : the more successful I am , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz@@ ing . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working institute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mom@@ my will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was sil@@ enced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t love my job anymore , the engine was out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours of busy weekends , no regre@@ ts , no regre@@ ts , a Titan sleeps , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me silence was silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was a pre @-@ display titanium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was grey , I just had no more fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the sum , and the sum was I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fade ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; today you &apos;re stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know you do it to be a teacher , to be a teacher , to be a teacher , to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I want to say no , when two things become conscious of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no longer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ ming be@@ sts , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bo@@ unds , can &apos;t do anything except watch out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax po@@ isons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; is released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air in this place is so tight , that I can hardly breathe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me resol@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental door rises , and an energy boost comes in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble but it is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now , I feel like I would know a magical mystery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums , the sums of labour , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe to you with the aid of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums are not a force , and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing depends on love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , expectation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz@@ ing again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing is not enough to me , as I work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ras@@ hed around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make small dance parties .
we sing and play ball .
we rip soap bubbles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always take my cell phone , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ man or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for fifteen minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only 15 minutes , but there is no need for more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can bring up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play , generally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find out , and keep it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m breaking and winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was playing a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum came back in my spare time , and the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work does not work without playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not I ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is now my sum@@ ming .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem is playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more happy I and my children are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the troops , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life is wide within me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this sum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like , I &apos;ll stir you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly have one of the best known , the &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; the electrodes im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I was a Senior Consul@@ tant and worked in the emergency department day and night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , I provided patients with cereb@@ ral @-@ brain trauma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is tw@@ ins and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece , it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to flour@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after many attempts , Jean François was able to succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spread slowly , and after a few weeks they even died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , why do they get us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we do not know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find it near brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not so sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source allowing brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean François did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final step , we reim@@ ported it at the removal point of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ spl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what happens when we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ proved exactly the same cells , and now the cells were preserved -- they grow up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence they show are these small d@@ ots . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets of a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we passed the motor @-@ motor range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it happened to people , they spontaneously recre@@ ated up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we planted its own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side you see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to the injury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so precise , and not so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , seeing the cells reim@@ ported it : the same monkey , two months after im@@ plantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can tell you , that was also very exciting for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our dream is still im@@ planting it with the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments , and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ on@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ar@@ dent friends who told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a false belief , could save us , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognise the debt berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , few recognize his twin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash which , however , is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing estates , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds after much money , until you compare it with the $ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blow out the stock markets and boost real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low aggregate demand that could not invest in the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily introduces the circumstances , which cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is my sh@@ od with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of patri@@ otic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to be taken by the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and is , that it gave them the right to freedom of expression , but was more important and decisive for them to grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is burned quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- namely the world of corporations -- was a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually under@@ mining politics and em@@ power@@ ing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because it cannot be in the government today , and yet not in power because the power is migr@@ ated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ od with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals of which they nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of corporations is increasing , political goods are being de@@ valued , political goods are being de@@ valued , the economic inequality is falling and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ary to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , this is not a new idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago , and it was not very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is , as long economics and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we will end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve humans and people indul@@ ging their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , we must be optimistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it take , how could it look to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; @-@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practical implementation , I would like to name you shortly , some examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the business sector : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows from one employer to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and income comes from redemption , and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who belong to companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos . &quot; and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was that at that time , one did not have the technical means to implement it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , particularly against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world I describe is at the same time the liber@@ t@@ arian in whom it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a matrix , a similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer depends on how we decide together politically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands , and we are doing it better democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your biography , you describe yourself as a liberal Marxi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to that of the Great Britain of the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Liber@@ alism and Liber@@ als like John Stu@@ art Mill --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was particularly scep@@ tical , concerning democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what can be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China is now acc@@ using to do what the West has done in the 19th century , enormous to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : I am sure , that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first six months of the year ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us , and the permanent denial that a massive over@@ throwing line through the euro area proceeded and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be a while , but when the changes enter , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , unless we change its structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody , who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ ouse ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a Minister of Finance or any minister , after 6 months in office , especially in a tense situation , he claims that he has no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of the len@@ ders , to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the disp@@ ar@@ agement caused by the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not want to admit that for 5 years , they have been conducting a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG , we hope that you are wrong at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being part of TE@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price has never heard most of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are so many TV series , so Roy wouldn &apos;t choose any one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will your show be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted to your brain : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care to get on the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ score &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle orbit , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , he must make sure that he is really on the right side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he will keep a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then producing the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where everyone can watch them for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if Amazon has nothing to do with vain things , do you get right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you jump over and look again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com more than four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they use these data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered into a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ experienced companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the logic states somehow , that it should work with everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data analysis does not work in such a way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence for this data analysis despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always the best results are generated , it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the data of the most experienced companies is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all these errors , data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we should make sure that data are helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ supported gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as deciding for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , I have identified some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do so several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable to put the parts together again , and then come to a resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they competing for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a sure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things can go wrong when data starts to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is only a tool , and in order not to forget this device , this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I will f@@ use it with a technique demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks you land at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
