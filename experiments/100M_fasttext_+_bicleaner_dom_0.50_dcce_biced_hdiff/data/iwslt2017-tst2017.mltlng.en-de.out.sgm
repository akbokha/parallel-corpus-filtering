<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "but do you know who the chapter did not like?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has identified risks and asked him to call his alleged sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spy on journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they are revealing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government clicked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though, for years, it was essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of separating and splitting, they could do their digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today there are communication software that has not yet existed, as cracks his book had written, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such a technology is SecureCode, an open source transfer system for whistleblower that was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, which was originally developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money] in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>

<seg id="45">"" "" "" "we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>

<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, has tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is said that a track of $2 billion goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next exposed documents." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "now that sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John Grisham novel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "it seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and hide their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matryoshoot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "I find it interesting, too, that there are less reports on this matter in the USA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "probably because there were no prominent Americans, who were present in these revelations, this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans, who hide their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"" "" "" "however, due to the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="66">"" "" "" "if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="76">"" "" "" "none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody got money. but it shows the problem with this system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician, implicated in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "it may sound very ridiculously as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="810">"" "" "" "with some help, the brain can help itself." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="817">"" "" "" "instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "to grow cells of a tissue piece, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>

<seg id="830">"" "" "" "the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"" "" "" "they never die, they are immortal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"" "" "" "they split slowly, and after a few weeks they even died." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellum cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>

<seg id="853">"" "" "" "and then mark them in colour, in order to be able to follow them in the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="854">"" "" "" "in the last step, we planted them at the receiving table of the same individual." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"" "" "" "thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="859">"" "" "" "in the second scenario we added an injury to and reimported exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they grow up to mature neurons." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"" "" "" "when they had reached a stable skill level, we passed the motor skills range in the motor cortex." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="869">"" "" "" "as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="870">"" "" "" "just as it happened to people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="871">"" "" "" "the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="872">"" "" "" "when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="873">"" "" "" "on the left, they see the monkey which recovered spontaneously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "" "" "it is not so precise, and not so fast." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" Films, TV, Technology, Tacos. "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the valuation goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"" "" "" "if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1066">"" "" "" "you record when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you jump over and watch again." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1073">"" "" "" "his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">"" "" "" "instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
