<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before anyone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "but there is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "if that sounds crazy, read it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has determined against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spy on journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they are revealing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government clicked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped to cracks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less and less." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of splitting and splitting, they could do their digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his consent, kept his phone calls secret," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "as well as his email data, finance and bank information, his credit meeting, and even travel tips with the list of his flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "unfortunately, this is only one of many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blogger went to a journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive because the government has more and more ways to pick up everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just as the government's technology permits to bypass reporters' rights, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today there is communication software that has not yet existed, as cracks in his book had written, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such a technology is SecureCode, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swarz." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of sending an email, go to a news site like that of the Washington Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there you can upload documents or send information, just like in any ordinary contact form." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective message agency has access." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government can no longer obtain information, and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureCode is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important for us to ensure that not only technology scientists, such as Edward Snowden, have a chance to bring out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "or the next environmental representative, who wants to report an alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money] in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, has tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is claimed that a track of $2 billion goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous, waiting for the next release, and the documents unveiled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "now that sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John Grisham novel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "it seems, weep away from you, me, ordinary people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "around the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and hide their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matryoshoot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "I find it interesting, too, that there are less reports on this matter in the USA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "probably because there were no prominent Americans, who were in this Disclosure, this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now, it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"" "" "" "however, by the principle behind which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="66">"" "" "" "if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "in fact, there is less information in some US states to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="69">Cheaters are allowed to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">"" "" "" "here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"" "" "" "so, we sent a covert investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked us that all except a lawyer made suggestions for how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody got money. but it shows the problem with this system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, wrapped in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "it may sound absurd as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing has ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">"" "" "" "but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen surpasses to greater transparency, as regards the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013, in Northern Ireland." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU is in central registers at a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lagged behind here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have made a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">"" "" "" "for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "" "" "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"" "" "" "with some help, the brain can help itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"" "" "" "at that time, I was a Senior Consultant and worked in the emergency department day and night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="813">"" "" "" "often, I provided patients with cerebral-brain trauma." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="817">"" "" "" "instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "to grow cells from a tissue piece, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="822">"" "" "" "you have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to flourish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"" "" "" "after many attempts, Jean François was able to succeed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"" "" "" "it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="829">"" "" "" "maybe you know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells, which can transform into every cell type of the organism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="830">"" "" "" "the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"" "" "" "they never die, they are immortal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"" "" "" "they spread slowly, and after a few weeks they even died." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"" "" "" "in the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="844">"" "" "" "but, why do they get us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"" "" "" "we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find it near brain injuries in higher concentrations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="847">"" "" "" "however, this is not so sure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="848">"" "" "" "however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source allowing brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean François did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="853">"" "" "" "and then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="854">"" "" "" "in the final step, we reimported it at the removal point of the same individual." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what happens when we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"" "" "" "thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="858">"" "" "" "in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="859">"" "" "" "in the second scenario we added an injury to and reimproved exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they grow up to mature neurons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">"" "" "" "the evidence they show are these small dots. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="863">"" "" "" "of course, we couldn't stop here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"" "" "" "when they reached a stable dexterity level, we passed the motor-motor range in the motor cortex." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="869">"" "" "" "as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="870">"" "" "" "just as it happened to people, they spontaneously recreated up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="871">"" "" "" "the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="872">"" "" "" "when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we planted its own cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="873">"" "" "" "on the left side you see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "" "" "it is not so precise, and not so fast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="876">"" "" "" "now, seeing the cells reimported it: the same monkey, two months after implantation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="877">"" "" "" "I can tell you, that was also very exciting for us." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>

<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slender, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" Films, TV, Technology, Tacos. "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1050">"" "" "" "will your show be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>

<seg id="1066">"" "" "" "you record when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you jump over and look again." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1072">"" "" "" "it's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "" "" "his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">"" "" "" "instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1076">"" "" "" "when they had all the parts together, they entered into a risk and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "" "" "yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons." "" "" ""</seg>
