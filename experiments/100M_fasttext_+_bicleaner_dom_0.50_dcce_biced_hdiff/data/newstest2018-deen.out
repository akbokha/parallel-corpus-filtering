Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view to the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Irish prison , where young people should meet today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cryp@@ t , which is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
small@@ po@@ gar@@ den@@ ers farm the former cause of peasants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oldest official map of Munich , promotes exciting stories about days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets annoying , if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone knows this , which had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ it street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historic maps of the digital Bayern Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with up @-@ to @-@ date online maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it becomes clear , how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which you can &apos;t recognize as such . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large map map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation sheets , were incorporated for towns and communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ surve@@ ying Act , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria , of course for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9th , 18@@ 01 , it was the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph moved forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with Bay@@ erische Ver@@ surve@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most impressive example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after the creation of the map , which was founded in 18@@ 77 as Munich subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the west park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : a small map with dozens of lines and numbers is displayed : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ intake &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , little par@@ c@@ els occupy no more farmers - but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sonne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the October Festival since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; on the guest dough &quot; or on the elevation &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Irish Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was founded &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called mad@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he prohibited personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places were extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ s Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um , Munich , meet at the former Au@@ er Institute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Casa Don Bos@@ co built the children &apos;s house - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the heart of Munich , the Second World War brought a decisive change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big one remained until today , at Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where the ground@@ breaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Rights Group publishes travel warning , Mis@@ sour@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for Col@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to claim discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim for minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , which the organization has issued for a state in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be charged 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring money to deposit or to let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s report program of the FBI which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such injuries to the 16th R@@ ank of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a success project and will continue next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U members , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac , have taken a picture on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his operations , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many kit@@ tens and accommodated in five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as swi@@ vel@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on such steep areas , I can &apos;t generate profit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green area care for a lot of work , a lot of things need to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and run it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he did not conduct a bio @-@ business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the commun@@ e has recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the leader &apos;s support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope , that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted over Le@@ aders , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explains Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and women &apos;s women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also noted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite for this is the presence of a sponsor@@ ship named by L@@ PR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the fenced area must not be pper@@ ary ( incl@@ ination above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ au@@ ric project in 2018 , the motion of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which want to build just 16 kilometres of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore , the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the ump @-@ Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ors would have liked him , if he had done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 was added to his base sevent@@ een years after the monument was completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; on our screens was better seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American republi@@ cans , showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a used classical ima@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she gives herself a completely different name , mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception of perception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their torch should not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black , Scottish Members of the Great Britain Team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics director , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the road corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their surrender speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought very naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ dles at their fifth world champi@@ onships , says that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year , five British and two European records set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chosen me make it something special for me . &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb at po@@ di@@ ums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for my speech , as a captain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess up a public office , if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he dis@@ continued with criticism , sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people , which have expressed their views on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week at the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na @-@ und ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict observ@@ ance of principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very skill@@ ful using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters , and to lose his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , blocking people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered officially and of employees paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not fil@@ thy , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , and they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking an critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but exactly , that just happens digitally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users , which were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mile@@ stones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US district magi@@ strate James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she served a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter writer struck his lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain were over@@ powered , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not put them into silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and true guidance means to accept this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort within the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Arch@@ er@@ field links right up to the En@@ dr@@ unde last year , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the Club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid this place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an avi@@ d advocate of this game , and is proud of his performance here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly good , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday returns to the action on the homeland floor .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing back , and I played a solid golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy as it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he approached an own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in the time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the manager of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of domestic connections the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground which is not noticed in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic , which continues to hin@@ der construction work , is a major problem for the construction group of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed , and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p , have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her log house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ men in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is harvested and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor floor - it has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard and there are soldiers here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupying forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ é and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under poverty and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , grass@@ land , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Papua New Guinea has a value of estimated US $ 78 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 islands have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , were genocide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police last year arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week passes incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screws have intensified , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim immigrants from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ped cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado - a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai Local in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the native Papua - the Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua New Zealand has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children came out and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frigh@@ tened children told them , that they should switch off their head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone and later returned to four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , one of the soldiers fired into the group of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , who was 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance , im@@ it@@ ating in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some demonstr@@ ators started to drag stones to police and military posts , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official TI@@ ME document not released by the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ aking , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kay@@ aking still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only we@@ ars a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw him was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed , and many others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of security , Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were in the 90 &apos;s , and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1999 , Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he still lives in fear , years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police attacked villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who was near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were delivered quickly , so TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to account for the officers involved , and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ ble@@ maker for the Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Syrian Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claimed to defend the rights of the Papua by star@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; security of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat , especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ é Airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely has capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far off from Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , restrictions in reporting international media remain tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although rare permission was given to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s election campaign to boost transparency and development were not realized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historically , the same countries have supported the O@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the rebels say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that they may never send justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus on his head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called coinci@@ dently the Tor@@ ch Tower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units had extingu@@ ished the fire at 4 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) , and the building cooled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from facing , exterior trim for decoration or insulation came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) , with its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p , fell through at the general meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single was not only able to play on two winning sets , but th@@ in@@ ly supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ pack classics remain the traditional competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.3 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members nation@@ als have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ con@@ ical and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to work on improving the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until after the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to carry out the final at a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : in the following year , the fin@@ alists will be hosting the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the costs for the event organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will need less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among passengers saw that more than 20 percent of intentionally or un@@ intentionally forbidden items were smu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while using accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 per cent said they would have discovered that they had wander@@ ed accidentally with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of those surve@@ yed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , members of Generation X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common objects , which were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 percent , know@@ ingly reported items with blades through security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that the people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry out smu@@ g@@ gling - by security , those who fly most often . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are often unsure which fluids they can take , or how much of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ genius El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of reservations for his new Tes@@ la , Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he has so far prevented that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less glossy number for the first time in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition just begins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars one : 6@@ 3,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critics always pointed out , that it is only non @-@ binding reservations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la is paying the 1000 euros ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding Reserv@@ ations are available at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , all models should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 one million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you order a Model 3 today at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if it comes to major delays , the liability of the reservations for Tes@@ la could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the delay in the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air pollutants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention the complaint , which had been lifted up against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to respect the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to study the plan and avoid the plan to interfere with local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that reflect the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama Administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ anol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards is simply the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administr@@ ations the EPA often did not comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then being accused of being charged by activists and other parties , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet the opinion of the EPA said that at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority to make sure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month is intended to delay implementing the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Senate , the measure has not yet been set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had accused the EPA during this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ ing the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yorker and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to spur on environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tumours celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving and maintaining the oldest building in the village has made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ ours , their concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martin@@ i emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a unique rural jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württemberg Ur@@ als : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the hill with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , beside the former parish church , a magnificent courtyard belonged to which the Church or the patron belonged , and not vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there were also people there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Office of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old maps dating back to 1600 , under@@ pin these historical facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval Church law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a master who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also hei@@ rs this church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connected with this was the right to use a priest , or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ gest of the two ch@@ ained to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed down during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were carved and the bells were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the deaths of audi@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split up the church tower and half collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the tower , which is still existing today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt student grammar school , and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s local leader speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to end the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view across meadows towards the forest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
organisation wants to let approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for construction and therefore faces the Council of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has urged Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval decision is still illegal and therefore to take back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to take the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a approval by the district government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been addressed by district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle takes them to the occasion , to examine the matter again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as an investment in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , a terrible traffic accident happened at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , a woman was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other people were easily injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as esc@@ ort the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the locals to the shopping center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should be able to sensi@@ ti@@ ze its customers , which offers the city &apos;s own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the downtown shops will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the action aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags point out to Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal office and the commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the commercial association and the city go to a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; on the well @-@ known Sunday , talks with all trade operators and hosts in order to make them active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or opened again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , guests and tourists belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also , many local residents would have lost the city center at shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , businesses all over the city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broader , in the spring said the king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the I@@ HK and many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence their direct environment with their buying behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new other people were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fire department , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man died , when a part of a school building collapsed at the explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a first missing , later , was found dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the dead , it was employees of the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the holiday period , only a few people stopped in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after scre@@ ened tran@@ scripts of telephone calls , Tr@@ ump made under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to tell publicly that he would not pay for a planned wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him , because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or to pay Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; l@@ ousy &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ res : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and rum@@ ored to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped forward to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strike , took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ am torn the silence , when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily this terrible scene , played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were used by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State Georgia , and a life @-@ long citizen law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community , that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court physician lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI the black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ es &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she bore was not from her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when they came close to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution who was not only involved in the murder , removed evi@@ dences and interro@@ gated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has managed the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her presentation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to watch , and to look at it more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - came into a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the har@@ ester sh@@ red@@ ded and urged him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then everybody ( at least , all black actors ) breaks out in laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only have to make the hard &quot; R. &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship sub@@ stitutes the discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition ends violent , and quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are cries , kis@@ ses and then silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed in grief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mo@@ urn &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen audience caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all experienced George &apos;s oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks runs her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ es and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying . the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience sat together with actors for dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the after@@ market with a black pair that they just got to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone thinks Broo@@ ks is sitting at his desk , eating and remembering the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he already started planning the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything about it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; - the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a demonstr@@ able road corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin - a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ston &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as rock@@ ers , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s mission - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine kill@@ ings - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise just like in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a cor@@ pse in the luggage compartment in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the ri@@ fl@@ o cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous evil Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brut@@ ally the scene when he was Siegfried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my in a stor@@ my way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with eag@@ erly anticipated , the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a table of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert - five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max crowd works as a volunteer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their volunteer year , they work in several places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where to go anywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I have already worked at school in the open day of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ year volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does that come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : I have taken a secondary school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe also , really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always depends , where you are doing your FS@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can make it from the old home to youth work , in all possible facets of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could see my own strengths and see , how it really runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : well , it &apos;s not about taking St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you always have other people in front of you , who have a completely different story behind you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth born out of the family - it is always necessary to respond to it individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : therefore , I am not the type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an area , which gives a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts announced by the Director General John Fall@@ on will be in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost reduction programme a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which had sold his stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged since the first half of the year achieved an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , announ@@ cing an explanation of NATO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing is the last violence hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement , it means that the explosion on Thursday night was to be taken when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital , at the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ agan is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilians in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban said they had carried out this attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , by which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which in some parts of the country should be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a broad range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that aims to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was clear : two pairs of votes unanim@@ ously decided to establish a communal space in the future retirement residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of land is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it will still last until the church community has been owned by the community , there is now no need for planning a project for the project to be stopped by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the Community are floating in front of such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ iors just , but openly in the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be made possible by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ aden , carrying 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision proposed to signal the investor is that in this respect , one wants to throw a bil@@ let between the legs - as well as the seat roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - which would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , this add @-@ on is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps , it happens to the body unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings with which one does not move so much , but now you lean in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking to the common room , but absolutely against a municipal involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks , however , a hidden subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , as with the purchase of the area there is no need to grant a subsi@@ dy , but I receive a real counter @-@ value in the case of doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three pro@@ pon@@ ents are found to susp@@ end the proposed resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that sum@@ mar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ ding with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior wanted to cross the road to the Bus@@ ch , the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same direction , passenger car driver granted him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the opposite traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he joined a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old remedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man was thrown onto the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered severe injuries , and was brought to a hospital by a rescue carriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without him , the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel care of German football championship champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , it was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
migr@@ ating in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association Observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information for many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members want to set up boards along the planned route , and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good achiev@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the boards should be complemented by the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the star path will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts about the physics of the single stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it lies considerably farther away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequently , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the university town , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Plan@@ etary in Göttingen since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system the planet trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to de@@ degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet , are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is four kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting battle in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , who went down the hall@@ way to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Spring weight champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion , Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pair for photographs posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen to 140 pounds for Bron@@ er , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run down to weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move on weight @-@ wei@@ ghted material &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to cont@@ end with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he likes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow ... I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show head@@ strength , then boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both said , they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injured after tyre placement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 hrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car dropped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ hit and then stood on the roof in the green strip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four in@@ mates , two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two opponents were against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle should also be further optimised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a release , the Fort@@ une doesn &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team , even after the experience in preparation with the Drei@@ chain , is better mastered than with the four @-@ chain chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ y , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half @-@ position in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we can &apos;t afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a dis@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight game days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ y and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una interior distributor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland act as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s boss coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , Funk@@ y wants to experience his players on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ter@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until today , migration has been sent 6@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may &quot; possibly be under 18 &quot; old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan Gö@@ pp@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have weighed over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person said frank@@ ly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age assessment , in X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of men to see if they were used earlier or later as usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot certainly say it , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ c@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Transport in the government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , the works began at the same time on all three of the need for rehabilitation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the construction is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a marginal fastening , which is also used as an operating track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide brid@@ ging cap is to be used on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines required by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach has special finger@@ tips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is also a fibre optic cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the work , local residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated via a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of the three bel@@ fry is 700 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest at German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a guard is coming together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Stad@@ thalle invites to the poster &quot; great election campaign kick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ l@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally planned for a picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking space below the r@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a colourful picture , which is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the president of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D have come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially questioned in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there was not enough parking available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the r@@ ond@@ ell , we are happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also does : at 8 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are around 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can cr@@ inge , no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a meeting with the Wolf@@ mann Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Kloster Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ji &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ts the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both combines the desire to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the two as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz cup bearer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating total art work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core of the program was first performed in Freiburg , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially for the two musicians , and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses , and they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately deals with bitter@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin assured the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with everyone I have ever wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it has never been confused or hin@@ dered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them , she suffered as &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school age , when she would rather dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to show yourself in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump predicted a HU@@ GE announcement before the West Virginia rally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive and engaging message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been sn@@ apped out of competition gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF con@@ s@@ ented to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , following a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at athle@@ tics champi@@ onships that start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free , said he reports in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers fired up in Mali
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two are commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the cause of un@@ solved crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they called the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen arrived on Wednesday , a week ago in West African Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the reverse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rod @-@ headed tmann set up the flight operation of the fighting helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar , and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody could have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ers were brought out of the cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gave the Royal House on Thursday , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You agree with the decision of her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be a king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired , laying down the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first few years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and those in Germany had the reputation of being the brand of society critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be content with this position , not ashamed of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the parliament &apos;s resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to welcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the relationship has been reversed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14 , 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government now has to decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l is indispensable , however , that the day of the holiday decides as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Constitution also sees the possibility , that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament el@@ ects confidence and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be tested legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ we@@ ster@@ ly &apos;s step , &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party called for the sovereign parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her administrative mandate which she has received from the green national list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chair@@ men of Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president An@@ ja P@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately chose not to pron@@ ounce foreign language pron@@ unciation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of S @-@ D de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on , El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly elect the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exit of T@@ we@@ ster@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and their fru@@ stration their personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony complic@@ ates this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to persu@@ ade his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , raised the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 country election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the Parliament &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge , and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if we know what we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightened person is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation , it has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment are available to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the residual hardness of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in case of eggs , they are not market@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of an emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there only a lack of personnel , or the conclu@@ sive competence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can occur are of vital importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ erts really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and secure food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the acquired means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ delivering animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on all levels , it must be consistently and with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all relevant authorities to clarify the facts quickly and seamlessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A because the executive organisation controlling the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power @-@ rich royal family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must interact with legitimate revenue sources that enable them to play the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners pulled back their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the cash discounts for the next five years of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies , associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market records , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was de@@ ferred from the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar , on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup , could come to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup am@@ bass@@ adors will simply be able to find out such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to heed every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 , with sales of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros , has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservation of La Liga against a state that finances an association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the fair fair because you can pursue different paths or have different interests , if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , chocolate has made Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard chocolate for Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request , confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years , and subject to quality control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight atten@@ d@@ ants , packed 17 million , distribute packed chocolate tablets to 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieved annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a shock manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many applicants , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and a half years ago , Swiss launched the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline collabor@@ ates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are spo@@ ilt by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class , Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also distributed on the short circuit by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympic Champion Robert Har@@ ting reaches World Cup final
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , the triple World Champion will compete for a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , failed in the national championship race and was only able to see the disc@@ us competition from the grand@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5,@@ 13 meters far , qualified for the final battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ able era of permanent memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it included an original story for an attractive jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play great children who will grow up , but still manage the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; with its grown @-@ ups that now play adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the pedi@@ gre@@ es principle including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character viol@@ ates an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy P@@ lot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lower lip from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now recalls another type of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East vs. West ring tac@@ tic icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comedy made by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ se J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ised in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , like Americans might do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of the famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was edited on a lower length could better deliver his agit@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong , we even make it with our own younger history and theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coup against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the Prosec@@ ution &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 , and 77 years of age were arrested and arrest warran@@ ts issued against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , officials issued large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , German arrest warran@@ ts were issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the two are probably shipped to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of the Ma@@ fia have accused organized drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office for comb@@ ating drug trafficking has been established in southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four servants from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Italian citizens with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia declined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
way to complain large gaps in the foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a media report , the commission@@ er for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigration register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , defects in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are listed in the register , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the data is managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data were not maintained adequately , the data quality in parts has not been good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who wouldn &apos;t have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false assignments , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it means that BA@@ MF is carrying out such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible for the newspaper to refer to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national spokes@@ woman of the left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation service to other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shares 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the council traditionally acknow@@ le@@ dges the multi@@ fold willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are created for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , corn makers reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatres has led to higher numbers of atten@@ de@@ es a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Sandra Schö@@ ck , were awarded a prize for 50 spent blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half as many are selling Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer and Petra Schle@@ mer and Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave away 10 times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation over an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 % , while less members were able to increase their support for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and anticipated by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income is expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to re@@ strain the inflation of inflation , and it said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic stimulus package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat higher &quot; extent than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year , and another in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; would be gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year will be compared with the 1,@@ 9 % and 1.7 % expected in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after these messages , the pound fell to the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate increase and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight increase in wages , as the sharpen@@ ing gets worse first before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years was not able to &quot; prevent the in@@ comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Over@@ write in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent rate of swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as the credi@@ tors would like to quit business and end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with roy@@ alty @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people affected by controversial HIV drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fight before the High Court , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) received before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the Health Service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the process , after confirming the Supreme Court &apos;s ruling last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such medications can be taken every day , or so already two hours before sexual intercourse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appropriate participants are identified in hospitals , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and registered with a GP , can also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is used on a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted towards patients who are vulnerable and vulnerable , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was found , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to help people who are HIV infected , and that it will help us to step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet space and an mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ hed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where you could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to function longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional tie in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing , through good design and increased square footage of something standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument because of one of Vic@@ tori@@ as the largest property imperialist in the value of over 500 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers built 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , West@@ co &apos;s family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now encompasses offices in the city centre , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her deceased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality , &quot; described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court case states that this means that Col@@ in property , valued at $ 3@@ 16 million , and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Paul , the distribution of real estate and cash has turned out to be a point of problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statements proposed by Col@@ in made him leave with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but asks Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it presented by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in says that he started in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Luke and Mark were , Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in has held himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the company and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS , to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress up and dress up our sur@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I end up in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved in the near future from the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the mass media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have tried , and failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , John F. Kelly can actually do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the chief on a regular course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with leading employees on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of places that were too convincing , &quot; said the former campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to holding tr@@ ump t@@ witter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps &apos;s t@@ witter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others , that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have had more combus@@ tible substances without their interventions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees managed to keep it away from him several times , their efforts paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no one has consistently avoided it , that Tr@@ ump has spark@@ ed controversy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly attempt to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Materials , which may promote their views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co , dealing with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ er to the advis@@ er to the president for strategic reasons doub@@ t@@ ful information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an example , described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can get to know wh@@ ence they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone malicious to the President mali@@ ciously gave a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jump was reading the article , and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and be hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this summer , the police all over Europe ( virtual ) post@@ cards are sent to dangerous criminals on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the addresses of the severely injured severely mur@@ ders are not yet known , references from the population will be collected and requested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting places hide on holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online vou@@ chers could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to publication on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travellers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ ef@@ oot , which have negotiated a tren@@ ch from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought the horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had only been thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems , and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ ging inhabitants pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they were moved there on Monday evening , after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the University Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road , and I am not happy to continue to pay my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who did not want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important to contact the police as many residents as possible by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the judgment must check , when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated , and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof thanks to its ambi@@ ance operating company lt@@ d. till 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues also went through the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan , to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious potential buyers at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ kirchen has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return to a house of the three star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ kirchen and one in Bad Herren@@ alt@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were torn down , ceilings partly broken down , old baths removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the city &apos;s performances are the same with those of the hotel group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when asked about the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outdoor facilities are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Agent suspen@@ ds Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few weeks , the body has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal called &quot; Wall Street Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper examines the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CN@@ N transmitter reported , there are already first invitations to the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. intelligence services have long bl@@ amed the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing with the presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mu@@ eller examines if there were agreements between Tr@@ ump election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation should focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under scrut@@ iny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the center and investigating whether the president might have hin@@ dered justice in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Swe@@ ys is to check the present evidence in potential crime incidents and decide whether the indictment is to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Grand S@@ ys are also called the dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the body can be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to interro@@ gate under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CN@@ N , invitations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , called it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. too , Tr@@ ump counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US TV , that the exposure shows that Mu@@ eller should not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he should act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the collapse of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this work usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that it was not possible to judge the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ eller , however , was only used after having fired Com@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for an investigation of the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later beaten president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several trans@@ formers of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators proposed bill designs on Thursday , after which the Special Agent could no longer be easily dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has developed from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s just seven times the size of Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer , is now driving north and probably will need two , three years until it has melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gar@@ gan@@ ts that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger for people , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent the climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ice ber@@ ges , it is unclear after research data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , however , for approximately 30 years , there has been a series of unusual cl@@ ashes of ice cre@@ ams in the region , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the broken col@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America , almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North of this ice shelf , the equilibrium of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s was dis@@ assembled there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken down , if a piece is broken off at a key point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; melting of ice @-@ ice and ice @-@ moun@@ ts does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it results after melting itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca , with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , it breaks regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural happening and aware of no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shaving file will grow back or fail in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though these researchers are not leading the breakdown of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ice cre@@ ams in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ car@@ ded over the past few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus number to the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U wants to rate house rate at staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U wants to exit from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circles in the circle seem to be highly sought @-@ after .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , approximately 6@@ 20 applications were to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , wants to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but also to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for star@@ ters and incorporate a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sounds like a good approach , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one did not know before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees , offering more attractive conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who dis@@ crete disease or age @-@ related reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the highest time for action is thus not to remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he long ago took care of a big surprise in the day of the circle , when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the remaining parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow leaving out of the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a ho@@ ur@@ ly tariff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and civil servants more than the tariff for the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed by law , increases or more money is only available if one changes to a higher level , oriented towards professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ uting law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they too have too little staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iss in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year now , refused to express a detailed alle@@ gation of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alle@@ gations that are currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is suspected that its crew is carrying the din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown over the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guards , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must especially have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential change or disability &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize @-@ winner organisation is doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ es@@ ota said in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants to be able to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ s@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation in the Wach@@ s@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ s@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ wald forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for the sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers found healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also headed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ wald forest from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga stands for e @-@ sport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium with wind and weather ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga clubs that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning in 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an E @-@ Sports division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs coming up this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming weekend , the FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first &apos; Interactive Club World Cup &apos; in London where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under the contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga message to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will challenge FIFA at a competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in normal sports , they have long since established li@@ gen in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but is it a real sport , anyway ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ar has dealt with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions , such as increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rob@@ bing however also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative impact of E @-@ Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are on the international road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te advis@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ ver inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and France , the So@@ ccer club clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to clarify the old times , is not enough today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on that only when football remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s negli@@ gent killing , which took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has not shown regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day when I did not get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will wear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosec@@ uted by the recognition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang yourself , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by the death of Roy , and ordered that she should benefit from any press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 , was convic@@ ted of murder by her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern tr@@ umps the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something else was different on his seat in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he stopped his arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer didn &apos;t tell it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards told behind after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the enem@@ a could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sign from the coach could point Kim@@ me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and straight out of vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar is widely distributed to those , who want to be trusted , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are chosen to take part in L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s legacy , you can use a small extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old came across the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right back , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Kim@@ me worked in this initial formation like the one , who can best take the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated trou@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ idal thought to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded not ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches made it possible to get out of the performance of the Asia trip ( also limited only ) , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall down neg@@ atively in their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , this worked out very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sw@@ amp ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ sto@@ cked Nap@@ oli assault was often difficult , and Sü@@ ver tried a few times in the build @-@ up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also showed a decent performance in the debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but appointed six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ me adopted a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ F@@ B ladies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ ball@@ ers , just before the game , reported on Twitter and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck , and with our trays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ating sp@@ lash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our ladies might need the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ sel@@ dorf well , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ hes Tempo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Cham@@ bers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a scheduled planning process until 2021 , the building rights should stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ road Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Ministeri@@ al spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ tmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims to develop a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to start their own business , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates do become independent within ten years of master &apos;s training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to set up Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be assigned to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group , points to calculations of the invoice , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than € 20 million in the preservation of country roads than proposed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the present broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ ined about pitch internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green faction left Lem@@ ke , April , to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she has already cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi is to change over 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens , and may cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising diesel vehicles emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of scor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies attempt to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested by Audi in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities had installed a system installed to b@@ ypass emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the study might heavily pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message has the raft on Saturday , on the Is@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who prefers to go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , who will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the building of the building , however , wants to clarify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of an publicity campaign , to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wild river is to be sharpen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at times , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the rab@@ bit n@@ oses of his figures are his trademark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still records and works on a film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish Im@@ migrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which makes him frustr@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large , round Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table , and works almost ten hours a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to find their dro@@ ll figures worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los loved any animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as a counterpart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened with climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , giving scientists and farmers trying to find solutions that cause major headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has been effectively exposed because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change and much more in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is much in the game , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are considered include improved water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sha in Thurin@@ gia is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .
festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medium @-@ age firm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cranes , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ inas or a refugee camp should be in the city centre on these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the Sin@@ alo@@ a State through organised crime , corrupt officials and perpet@@ ual drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were told , that it is important to change their routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of government or car@@ tels , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no rest of the violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are present : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been under federal law and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the latter are her editors and her inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez , in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties ; Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wearing t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , her night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a Son@@ der @-@ Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely challenged by journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the ground is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was fired from his car , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sho@@ oter drove away in his car , damaged it nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in January and the surrender to the United States in January as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , in February there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival monopoli@@ es in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for encouraging and honest reporting and sales and advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task as journalist to you - either that or you play the dum@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n @-@ bird who was able to flood the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , Was his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best , and to stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it smells false , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days prior to it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building , located in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who the governor himself is not trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has shown three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was murder of the brother of the former well known Box@@ ers , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated all the political levels almost throughout the century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months earlier , the readers could have viewed Val@@ dez &apos;s columns as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists became lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , accused journalists and killed them because they told the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has since asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an equivalent society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces dealing with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state , Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the T@@ et@@ as @-@ Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to their separate head , a computer keyboard and headphones lay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug car@@ tels with a leading article on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists fled from their home countries , or even from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , ad@@ mits that drug trade scar@@ es him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to h@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with bel@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the edge of the board , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible all over Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day where Ja@@ vier was assass@@ inated , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown , and they said she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; referred to it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er living in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to take a closer look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers found out that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is likely to be threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ preservation which is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say what hin@@ ders that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er made head@@ lines for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by eating meat ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ red@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the Din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors must have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay @-@ brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to study the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and pushed out into the sea where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sk@@ inn@@ ed skin , but retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks nearly the same today as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just fancy a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ y ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which were ra@@ iling from his shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant e@@ ater was swept through the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I watch it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ tery on A@@ 8 : many wounded
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , an accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous wounded , mile long runs - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ tery at the late afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , at 5 p.m. , between the junction points Adel@@ fen@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , were crashing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first place , there are no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was light to moderate injuries , a police spokesman said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of travel Munich , approximately ten kilometres of retro@@ sp@@ ect formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also happened on the back @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire department listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : the company is testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing pul@@ ls , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or one is deep@@ ened in his work , and has just a brilliant idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the creator , w@@ akes up an uns@@ ft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the Deutsche Bahn is testing the free ticket control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply confirm by phone , that you take your seat and invali@@ dates the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a test run is on two tracks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer depends , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at many further distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the rail without any conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use this , however , some requirements need to be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to book an online ticket , which already does most passengers anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also necessary to purchase it via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , you need a seat reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their mobile devices , the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message that passenger X is on the train and has taken the seat Y booked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the train ticket inspec@@ tor arrives at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting with an already paid online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can therefore continue to sleep , work on and keep silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you travel often , you know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often one has , but in any case one of the travellers do not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the credit card or the ID card is missing , or otherwise a document that needs to be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad spirits in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , only a small number of test customers can use the new service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is only for the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other numbers on the same route are not enabled yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; he thought Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but death was nothing new to them , and their community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police and people who sh@@ ook , and from a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who had a sign saying , &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ fle and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry , and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she retired her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation , which she had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she must know and see it , and be educated in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a disgu@@ sting racism , she is not different from the next black woman child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they prepared pockets and helped to spread them on demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , they and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as follows recently in an interview , &quot; We have heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his engagement brought the project nearer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as to how these people are represented , for in this way I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the in@@ humanity of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ lip @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black Germany Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identified themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the whole movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action , &quot; the he@@ el has been selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the intelligence cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years , because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home , &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose , except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it has not been built for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the first presentation in 2009 , the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone breaks the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ b ) , or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the start of the construction work , the end will be finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost weekly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the farm women very willingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the but@@ cher shop we discovered for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other cities , there is that too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can be found in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be too low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what was the shopping column in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , there is already enough in our town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how many stores are empty here , some for months and years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the goods offered there are freshly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not viable for a retailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes sometime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it already create the ghost bit gallery before , selling all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no need for a shopping centre , which is empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a farmers market hall , give thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair clips that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former intelligence service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after public@@ ising his secret diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent who had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment on the form of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also for identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the prison her picture was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press presentation of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became an un@@ equal rap@@ port , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a cartoon by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ vom@@ ited judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few days after the book was published , Obama &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome sort of happy meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to further develop the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring with us is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears with a hands @-@ free speech in the hands of the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they break your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book , but when she was supposed to do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was also purpos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford , for killing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a nationwide human race is in progress for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been stab@@ bed to death .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the counts as murder , while the police search for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been in a review and were excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson from the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ators in any conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that Var@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to prove himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that in apartment 100@@ 8 something happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 , 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and war@@ locks were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ kos agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has prior to accepting this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from the WA@@ DA by the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the conduct of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
this divided the company groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impairment , it was said in the communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been tested demonstr@@ ably neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with his customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ ups , which will help your company not become the next U@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce startup but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the rise , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to perform surveys , to employ specialist groups and demographic groups , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ Suite managers to circum@@ vent and direct themselves to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , CEO and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can drill down why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies are expected to remain at the forefront of workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that has been punished by those who have spoken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the Finance Technology website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and identify bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Enterprises makes customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a company is found that beha@@ ves poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the company Con@@ ver@@ cent is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously held in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical breach of the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and pol@@ lu@@ te the company with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ litter secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising in the face of the networked nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees can expect more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets like Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger commitment to success , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data on employee engagement is important in the workplace culture experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data is useless , if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can discipline dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 meetings , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much left for collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not following staff , ask yourself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this results in a better bond of employees in a sector known for high turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practices , making a long day for the fry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts at 11 p.m. , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have moved their tri@@ cot tops , showing the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was closed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M , in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the more busy routes of the player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pressed it , they plac@@ ken on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the Camp ends , which is not an easy task considering the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I don &apos;t worry too much about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against fake news
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with counter@@ f@@ eit detection by third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications , and to send them to fact test@@ ers that may show results of the fact test from the original article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check will be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its breaking news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cosy seat at the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des - a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz . William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the first book written by Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive , wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the page of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb expression !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters still smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I &apos;ve over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) seems all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted cup@@ boards on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape gather@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust obtained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to care about the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards representing what possessed , &quot; you might think land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go its course ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to appear on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ ys his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite bear@@ ers , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men redeemed their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ lords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for another unique write experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ nig , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since then returned from nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coating of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign is to give a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their last @-@ folded website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions in officers &quot; cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , a normal operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nothing is routine with Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Government of State , the five Vice @-@ Offic@@ ers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government , in the military , attracts re@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired up the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als in 16@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara is negotiating this week in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan referred to the revolution as a &quot; god present , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the major suit in the army and the security forces continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 coup d &quot; é@@ tat , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , gener@@ als were considered the real masters of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , they were calling on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular order of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say , Erdo@@ gan has targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a specially named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt against persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , NATO could not let Nato be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; said NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington alters the Green Card rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump stated , cited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more stringent requirements for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and visa restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by spending the way people out of other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new assessment procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quotes from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate track for ski lift
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months over the past few months , the future of the rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les has been denied - it is now to go very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , there is to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated circuit on which the tourist railway runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction works are expected to commen@@ ce this year following the announcement of the Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the road Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ weg the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important link for tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 2.5 million euros , the cost of maintenance of the route was estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this sum , the country is 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , is now fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia railway as an operator are already agreed on the technical details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Renn@@ weg shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rac@@ er shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations , Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested , whether the route is being used by a large number of people to order them again in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the route is in parts strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought it will not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , indeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his convi@@ ctions , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robot to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics that go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah worry most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to a little darker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they are nonetheless pro@@ vision@@ ally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what se@@ ep out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not strange or ab@@ u@@ sive , until the free market gives them permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has healed women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images that affects the secre@@ tive body and the e@@ ased eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically ( albeit with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot separate themselves from their companion , or simply go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or to express it in the speeches of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to handle the horror of relative relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all allegedly strain ourselves , in order to burst our filter bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
less noticed is the power Tr@@ ump to bring families together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long engaged with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited New York this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but I am aware of the fact that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the liber@@ ating effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that the kit@@ tens of one day will no longer be thrown off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans norm@@ alize &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasoning in comparison to his standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals rotate to look full of fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city are dis@@ ap@@ pointing : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the city &apos;s reality doesn &apos;t live up to the dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ five years later and I still am not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the Central Park car@@ ousel is still an odd magical experience , since two years of age , eleven @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same thing , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to enter a personality in a situation that is not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ us@@ ingly bur@@ sting , while I made tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us installed with chest pain from prison to hospital
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first death sentence following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , taking it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he was his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us men@@ tions that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler were released from caps and el@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on holiday and in the secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , three of the students go to grammar school , four at the secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te school leader welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a symbol for school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower ar carried out a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken erhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it apart from his chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him shat@@ tered , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wished each of the four @-@ dogs , that he felt accepted in his new school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by a thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always comes up with na@@ iss@@ ors and the parent representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time of the kitchen is over , the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years of teaching , she left her students very reluct@@ ant , because it was a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ blade chan@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight first class pupils have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia a group of illeg@@ ally ro@@ ving people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were released later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry said that the court can impose a fine @-@ penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what the stakeholders need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in this promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve exhaust emissions of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 diesel , or worse , are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the new promotion mandatory ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schum@@ an Software &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their retro@@ fit , the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) has ordered them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but have not yet called a precise date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler advised to write any person concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled within the scope of the inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will the conver@@ sions go , overall ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this depends on manufacturers &quot; commitment , as well as from political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could take only three to four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time @-@ consuming , it could be to get an appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ ce advises to wait .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is there a threat to a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the A@@ ce fears that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the regions , where the driving b@@ ans are threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ACE reveals , with a sale still to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted prestigious Kennedy Center awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) became the honored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards are handed over in early December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that he would refuse to take part in the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that weighs me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will take advantage of the conversation with Tr@@ ump , to clarify their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kennedy @-@ Zentrum , named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the greatest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Buil@@ der , retired in R@@ ente next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the work still gives him great fun , as he teaches in the press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , it is at the same time that no application satis@@ fies the requirements profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest possible time , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in compliance with the regular periods of notice , this should still be sufficient time for famili@@ ar@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ contractor for the administrative community , the applicant has to show relevant degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this function wants to keep the city in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they could no longer fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the proximity of citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good working climate as well as a good mood between authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the chi@@ ppers with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space are encountered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will spend some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of design , there is much room for a city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gardening , many people can react very flexibly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the landsc@@ aping of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what fits clean@@ ly when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the reti@@ ring city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , the City Buil@@ der has a high responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( building ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , you should have completed academic studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction management , property management , residential building with building yard and urban gar@@ den@@ ers , as well as lower building rights authority including historic monument protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bicycle thrown on lines : South track blocked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were so badly damaged , so that the approaching freight train had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ators depart from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the scene , a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator or the perpetrators would have brought in great danger themselves and also end@@ anger the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delayed minutes and the costs for rail freight transport , P@@ ön@@ es of the rail customers could also get to the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern run@@ way could be guided without disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of which were inter@@ connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains were not falling , but they delayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US , and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna said that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide inside the food do not penetrate into the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells capable of replacing inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging delicate tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also hosts people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Post@@ doctoral Doc@@ torate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell which found tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribal which was separately housed , did not have this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them lacking in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how bacteria appeared to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active component of the liquid has been puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells , such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday began and impressed in its keeper @-@ role as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was excluded from the pre @-@ supply Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve ahead of the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u joined the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three other new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier when they get four out of four for me , but they have made great efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drivers flew from Seattle to U.S. State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such commerci@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new fence for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was even SPD boss , S &amp; D prime minister always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only no fire @-@ fires from the party centre , merely a head@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with growing horror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprise fraction of Green Euro MPs pushed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green @-@ Federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the lower Saxony Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen has to give her mandate back immediately , &quot; said the Federal Minister and election leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an SPD elec@@ tor , when on Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ ob@@ offensive was reached by the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there without any government majority after the founding of the Green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what will happen next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ treated his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it became - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cleaned the party smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weeks after , the comrades lab@@ oured again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with him , the next blow came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in the crisis communications , he made quite anything wrong about what can be done wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous survey values were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the agreement in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attempt of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allowed him to grant him , as they promised a stabilization of the party by Wei@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the nature of the Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the absurd Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic as Mr@@ s T@@ westen places their own career dinner on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but on the Landes@@ bank of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann &apos;s chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group is lam@@ enting a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clarification of the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there have been more , or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding money for local people III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like to rehabili@@ tate his house in the years , will soon be able to get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the town development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1991 , there are remedi@@ ation areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project . &quot; finally , it is important to further develop the inner development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , the government of Karlsruhe announced the information that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest from the municipality of sens@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also plays a role , if there is interest in the planned territory to renov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the area boundaries could be shifted again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the rehabilitation would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be related to objects , i.e. , per plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1 January 2017 , the grants period for the grants will continue until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September this year , the inventory will be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the statute shall be set for as long as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commun@@ e must carry out the said pre @-@ examinations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about evaluating the urban development and deciding when to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the respective property , it will also be included in the land register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it deals with the structural condition and refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arc , &quot; information on the size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operating Stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if commercial premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were also shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ sten at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip , and takes only 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Nav@@ al helicopter for an event that highlighted American manufacturing in the past month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , which has been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car made of Wis@@ con@@ sin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft , the helicopter was manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn , and so long remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear , whether a second flight crew was finally required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could harm the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President is obliged to use them for the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but its use only for a photo operation , is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump performed an investigation in February when the presidential plane served in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often conduct training flights around Washington and the South La@@ wn area , in order to deal with precise centimet@@ res in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a jump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirements of the crew crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain any budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to St@@ und@@ tari@@ ffs of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Rat@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn of the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ gade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky representatives and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky job
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the leading third tennis league , S@@ V stands at the forefront of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss sp@@ ends at 11 am in Kiel at the stand@@ ings third S@@ V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any rate , team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V S@@ V , imports from the high North ensure above all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ s and Finn@@ s can even point to betting on the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ sch@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ ash ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently active in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won his first bet in this season at the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ casts was on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coaching station at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America can hurt O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy not , when he set his signature under the law on the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ funded with other European companies , have contributed to the construction of the Russian Eastern pastoral agency Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dro@@ h@@ ku@@ lis@@ se is huge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could ward off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the Hitler series of Net@@ fli@@ x moved to the centre
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teams of three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest performance of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as a Fort@@ une 500 company with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel . Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ vi ( Francisco Denis ) commands the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ole backwards : the town provides 46 kitchen aids
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table , itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with permanent contact persons for the children , and assignment to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the watch is turned back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will again take over food supplies in the city &apos;s day care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head in the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooked is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers freshly cooked co@@ ols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 nur@@ series , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last kit@@ esur@@ fing year , 2@@ 800 children were seated at the tables and the need grows continuously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for 45 days of the week , have lunch at the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have food service from 1 September : they heat up the supplied food , supplement them with salads , raw foods and fruits , divide the meal individually , drain , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a cab@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group units , decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , too : healthy food and cooking lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cleaning of the cab@@ ita rooms , so far , also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen , has also the charm that it has proven itself in comparison to the city as the most economical way , it is from the press office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 people in the educational sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible , if women fully participate and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections for the first time will pass the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ some said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
walk to the TV @-@ anniversary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the occasion of the 110 year anniversary , the TV Kaiser@@ ingen invites you to a small hike with subsequent coffee and cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hike starts on Sunday , July 9th , at 13 o &apos;clock in Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten of the water reservoir in the Ameri@@ kast@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there it goes to the airport , to the Nat@@ ter and through the forest yard back to the reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hike takes about one and a half hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that there will be coffee , cakes , cool drinks , str@@ ing@@ ed saus@@ ages and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to bring a Car@@ ic@@ ino from Kaiser@@ ingen to Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten , a meeting point is in Kaiser@@ ingen at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men attempt to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young men aged 19 and 23 , on Thursday , have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police information , the men asked the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stood up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , however , and went on with her friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a prey , the duo fled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the two young men could be arrested by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation is underway .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a trade union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500 people work in the plant , which in addition to other products hob@@ bies and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ K@@ tie &apos;s called on to &quot; express concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the large @-@ region Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager near T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate the continual engagement with employees and union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave after an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause but did they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ gi@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is always a source near the Catal@@ ans mind that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , three years ago , the football world was warned of the PS@@ G President ahead of this prospect ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereas the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G middle field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave it under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oter ti@@ cked and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday night , an unknown killer has deliberately thrown a sco@@ oter off the Royal Fiel@@ ds in front of the property number 30 , causing damage to over 200 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and hit the crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW stood on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came across his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an rider crossed the guiding line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
damage to the car was caused by material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it may well be good that the Mercedes driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are now asking for witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the prisoner &apos;s vehicle to get in touch with the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Regensburg bishop and Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express deep regret on their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee is striking about the attacks in Regensburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are welcome to go to the church and this is a found feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; pun@@ ches have been a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote to R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ sian , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly is written in the 4@@ 40 @-@ page report , referred to by the Federal B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clarification deleg@@ ated by Ulrich Weber ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it says Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by master cap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially with a high degree of emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , contrary to many other accused , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is relieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 4@@ 40 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence practice in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able when a dom@@ esti@@ cated record produced no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you take the trouble and read the whole 4@@ 40 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is all about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity in the horrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , too , took place outside of its sphere of influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at best , one can pre@@ tend to experience it too late or not have taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ sch@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was experienced by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s broad majority , as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , describes him as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he did not only throw up with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also attracted t@@ wit@@ ches and too che@@ ek@@ y guys at the hairs or ears , he himself has been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also lived in a secular school , a high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one wonders whether it &apos;s not about his reputation and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working dili@@ gently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is , the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put any involvement or co @-@ operation regarding sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have confi@@ ded himself to the cath@@ et@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they don &apos;t even famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it is certainly not a chor@@ us who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role , with regard to the mis@@ use cases ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student stated : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he would have had timely insights ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... box@@ ers more intru@@ sive or clearer , or more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , intermedi@@ ary managers , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; that the students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , he cannot be accused of not being able to prevent or display him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence processes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is accused of former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clearly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence processes as well as , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the report also treats events from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ spar@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the terrible testing pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of the sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous and suffered , were all acquired at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prevailed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ litter gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ litter gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a certain degree of discipline , but not a scor@@ stic force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many sacrifices have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even bring positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be stolen away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported to him by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the operations at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger follow the ears consistently in front of the states ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ind@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um who even reproduced the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool you will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was , of course , at a time when j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal clarity was not permitted in Bavaria too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards to the time of the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princess is already right , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resist@@ ors and violence against innocent pra@@ w@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all of this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when corpor@@ al punishment was then banned , it kept strictly forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has represented Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also available for language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to tour the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , un@@ ru@@ ly boys are now no great singers and stand in whatever field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks with her book ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond that , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experiences as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ believing , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly get how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tation , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who did not forgive him until now , that he was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he always has a good father@@ ly teacher - a strong father , sure that this may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for which she is still looking at and ad@@ mon@@ ishing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again , clearly : all you have to do is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ just to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the stand @-@ up would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
