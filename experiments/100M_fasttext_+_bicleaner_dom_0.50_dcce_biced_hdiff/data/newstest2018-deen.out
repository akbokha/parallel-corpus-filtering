Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Irish prison , where young people should meet today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pit chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the former reason , small@@ po@@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of peasants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oldest official map of Munich , promotes exciting stories about days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is annoying , if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody knows this , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historic maps of the Bavarian State Government , an offer of the Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare it with up @-@ to @-@ date online maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it becomes clear , how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which you can &apos;t recognize as such . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large map map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called exposure sheets , were incorporated into cities and communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bavarian Ver@@ surve@@ ying Department , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria , of course for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9th , 18@@ 01 , it was the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV set the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian surve@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison Past / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , which was in 18@@ 77 as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 alongside today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing as a field - at first glance : in zo@@ oming a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ itation &quot; from which the landed tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no more farmers there today , but small farmers from the plant &quot; Land in Sonne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the venue of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exposure sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the guest dough &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was founded &quot; On the Au@@ er Venti@@ lation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who was brought to Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called mad@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he prohibited personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients had initially been accommodated , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ s Hospital Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the former Au@@ er Institution , young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house Casa Don Bos@@ co was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the heart of Munich , the Second World War brought a decisive change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this day , a large one remained at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to resort to discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dispro@@ portion@@ ately turn out travel warnings said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights and people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin color , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , which the organization has exhibited for a state in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be charged 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring money or relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s report program , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the electric fence project is elementary
the fishing bacher pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Gra@@ vel Court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his operations , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many kit@@ tens and houses in five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black walnut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on such steep areas , I can &apos;t work profit@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things need to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and run it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not conduct a biological farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the commun@@ e has recognised the significance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leaders &quot; support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope , that the re@@ aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by 11 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was subsi@@ dis@@ ed over Le@@ aders , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and women &apos;s women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art fo@@ stering of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite for this is the presence of a conveyor belt , described by the L@@ PR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the fenced area must not be smu@@ gg@@ ler ( incl@@ ination above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ au@@ ric project in 2018 , there is currently a motion of eight participants with 24 plots which wish to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maintenance area is 35 hectares , while the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore , the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals to limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stay fair , Miller does not attack the statue itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him , if he had done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can , showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a used classical ima@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great writing h@@ ush R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has hit something here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the statue is completely , and even a question of the point of view of perception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great fan@@ ciful act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their torch should not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black gives Scottish Members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to do it until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought very naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ dles at their fifth world champi@@ onships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year , five British and two European records set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but also in some cases ming@@ le with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose to make it something special for me . &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb at po@@ di@@ ums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for my speech , as a captain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess up a public office , if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kno@@ cked at the criticism , sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he has not put his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 persons , which have expressed their views on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week at the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict observ@@ ance of the principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very skill@@ ful using Facebook as a primary means of joining himself with his elec@@ tors , playing his hair @-@ free head for chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is considered official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mail addressed some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pastor cited the Bible in his post , and appealed to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to assign a message by simply blocking an critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als and arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users , which were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mile@@ stones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should not be so hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter writer struck his lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ or@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ or@@ arius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his ministry , according to historical documents collected by George Washington Project Online Papers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and true leadership means accepting this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the ren@@ aissance club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort , because the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took part in Arch@@ er@@ field links right up to the En@@ dr@@ unde last year , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jer@@ ry made a great job , when he laid this place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is an avi@@ d advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken from the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday returns to the action on the homeland floor .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing back , and I played a solid golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy , as it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sh@@ all@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he approached an own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in the time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of domestic connections the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground which is not noticed in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , is a big problem for the construction group of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed , and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily , we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour , the stolen bulb is harvested and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard and there are soldiers here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement , which touched the Dutch rule for independence , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , then a morning five hour drive with a rental car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs that have been transformed into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under poverty and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , grass@@ land , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars in the amount of timber resources has been estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose , and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police last year arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week passes incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screws have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economies from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ped cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and ado @-@ go@@ ado ; a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants started to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local Papua - the Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua New Zealand has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children went out and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frigh@@ tened children told them , that they should switch off their search@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took impulse in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , one of the soldiers fired into the group of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , who was 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance , im@@ it@@ ating in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some demonstr@@ ators started to drag stones to police and military posts , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official TI@@ ME document not released by the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ aking , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly fired into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kay@@ aking still does not know who fired , but tells the bul@@ let coming from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only we@@ ars a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de said that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed , and many others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news of the kill@@ ings took place only the following day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set an out @-@ court mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were in the 90 &apos;s , and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he talked to TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he still lives in fear , years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ak@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ t@@ aries ) began shooting at the crowd , killing one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who was near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here quickly arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to account for the officers involved , and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ ble@@ maker for the Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Syrian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat , especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ é Airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs there are in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely has capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far off from Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , reporting international media remains tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although rare permission was given to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s election campaign have failed to raise the limits of coverage to promote transparency and development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the various and widespread violations in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historically , the same countries have supported the O@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May , locals broke their silence and urged him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has another presidential elections in 2019 , but the banks say that they are unlikely to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want just justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that maybe they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus on his head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one sometimes calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; said a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were fighting the fire at 4 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) , and the building cooled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from facing , exterior trim for decoration or insulation came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) , with its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p , fell through at the general meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup single was only to play on two sets of competitions , but not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ pack classics remain the traditional competition so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members nation@@ als have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ con@@ ical and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to work on improving the application , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until after the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to equip the final at a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new from 2018 , only comparatively small details are : the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the following year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training spots etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will need less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items into the aircraft , find a survey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among passengers saw that more than 20 percent of intentionally or un@@ intentionally forbidden items were smu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while using accidentally forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered that they had been mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of those surve@@ yed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common objects , which were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 per cent reported , know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , whereas 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was inter@@ viewed by travellers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that the people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those most often fly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are often unsure which fluids can take them , or how much of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise , therefore , that the greatest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ genius El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of reservations for his new Tes@@ la , Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he has so far prevented that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant number in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition just begins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars one : 6@@ 3,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1,000 ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non@@ com@@ mitt@@ al reservations are available at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 - All models should be put together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mus@@ k , reservations are currently available per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you order a Model 3 today at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if it comes to major delays , the liability of the reservations for Tes@@ la could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the delay in the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention the complaint , which had been lifted up against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on October 1 for states to respect the standards of 2015 for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to study the plan , and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations that reflect the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington has decided that the EPA authority has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its turn@@ around at o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administration , the EPA often did not meet deadlines for performing and then been accused of being accused by activists and other parties , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet the opinion of the EPA said that at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month is intended to delay implementing the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Senate , the measure has not yet been set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , headed by the Coalition of States , who had accused the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ ing the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to spur on environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tumours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preservation and preservation of the oldest building in the village , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens have made their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique rural jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Wald . &quot; Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the document according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , beside the former parish church , a magnificent courtyard belonged to which the church or the patron belonged to and not vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there were also people there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Office of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old maps dating back to the year 1600 , under@@ pin these historical facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval Church law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a pastor , continued to be the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connected with this was the right to use a priest , or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ gest of the two , at Christmas 16@@ 73 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed over in 1942 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were carved and the bells were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split up the church tower and half collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only the tower , which is still existing today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em care about the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius facility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt , and with presentations by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
North @-@ speaking Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and audi@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ med .
Association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is resist@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore faces the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has urged Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the club argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the urban area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones shall prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval decision is still illegal and therefore to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to take the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a licence from the district government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been addressed by district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle takes them to the occasion , to check the matter again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already last year , the company in which the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved in lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the construction of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NE@@ W Re @-@ wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , one of the worst traffic accidents happened at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ walled men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , a woman was wounded in death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother accompanied the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and distributor plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the residents to the shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze its customers , which offers their own city available away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the downtown shops will invite to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the action targets not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action weekend , are Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal administration and the commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the commercial association and the city go to a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with sales on Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts to make them active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or opened again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , guests and tourists belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also , many locals would have lost the city center at shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , businesses all over the city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said that with a network overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which partly wi@@ dened , the king had said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her direct environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new other people were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fire department , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , a missing one was found dead later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the dead , there were employees of the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cause of failure , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stopped in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after scre@@ ened tran@@ scripts of telephone calls , Tr@@ ump made under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Guide of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to tell publicly that he would not pay for a planned wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and Sw@@ or to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; dum@@ mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade reported by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the mo@@ bs , a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strike , took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams torn the silence , when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily this terrible scene , played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were cleaned by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State Georgia , and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court physician lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding County were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ es &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t come from her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when they came close to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evi@@ dences and interro@@ gated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has managed the annual re @-@ position of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her presentation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist in America anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and it &apos;s hard to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the remaining black - came into a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the har@@ ester cries out and har@@ dens him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then everybody ( at least , all black actors ) breaks out in laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to make the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replacing the un@@ e@@ as@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene once again begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition ends violent , and quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed in grief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen audience caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience is divided between black and white , almost uni@@ form@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have experienced Georgi@@ ans almost eight hours long , when Broo@@ ks runs her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ es and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air is sti@@ pen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms crying . the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience sat down with actors for dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one table , a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ted about the after@@ market with a black pair that they just got to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone thinks Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his desk , he eats and re@@ members the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he already started planning the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; has reconc@@ iled the inhabitants of Bay@@ reuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is putting on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e performance in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a demonstr@@ able road corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as Rock@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise just like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier break a cor@@ pse into the trunk and give the ri@@ fl@@ o cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the magnificent fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when he was Siegfried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Yan@@ ov@@ sky , who hum@@ bly bend their hands to the Merkel diamond , are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which presents itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty recreation clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with excitement , the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to have had another flute concert in 2013 , and five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its way of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max lot works as a volunteer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their volunteer year , they work in several places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where everywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I have already worked at school in the open day of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ year @-@ old volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does that come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : I have taken a secondary school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I realized that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus maybe also , really is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will study dual , I probably do a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it probably depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the retirement home to the youth work , one can do it - in all possible facets of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : well , it &apos;s not about taking St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one repeat@@ ed@@ ely has other people in front of each other , each having a completely different history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth born out of the family - one must always respond to it individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : therefore , I am not the type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an area , which gives a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much love , much kindness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job cuts announced by the General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which had sold his stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged since the first half of the year achieved an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , announ@@ cing NATO &apos;s explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing is the last violence hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement , it is called the explosion on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement says that all injured are in a stable state , and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ agan is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban said they had carried out this attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating what the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; and said they are showing the agency commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone rules - in which contam@@ in@@ ants must be measured in a portion of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a broad range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that aims to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and boost respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two pairs , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ tz@@ els decided to establish a common room in the future retirement home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it will still take some time until the church community has belonged to the community , there is now no need for planning a project for the project to be stopped by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ iors just , but openly in the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be made possible by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ aden , carrying 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is to signal the investor that he doesn &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs in this respect , that both the saddle and the roof top - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean that this add @-@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps , it happens unanim@@ ously to the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings with which one can &apos;t move so much , but now you lean out in the common room out of the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking to the common room , but absolutely against a municipal involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it , it sees a hidden subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , as with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but I receive a real counter value which is market@@ able in case of doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three pro@@ pon@@ ents will be found to susp@@ end the proposed resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that sum@@ mar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sions with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the direction of Hil@@ den coming from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch , at the height of the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Lan@@ gen@@ felder put on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the opposite traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met with a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man was thrown onto the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered severe injuries , and was transported to a hospital by a carriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without him , the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with staff worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel care for German football champi@@ ons Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , the Italian confirmed on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six reviews , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is planned by the association Observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information for many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members want to set up tables along the planned route , to inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the boards should be complemented by the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the star path will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewers learn a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more light than another , even though it is much further away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequently , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the university town , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Path in Göttingen since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system the planet trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to d@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet , are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , who went down the hall@@ way to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Spring weight champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pair for photographs posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former counter@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen to 140 pounds for Bron@@ er , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to drop down on weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he has to move on weight @-@ wei@@ ghted material &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to fight with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later resolved to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can draw this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he likes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the triple champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly ... I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show head@@ strength , then boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both said , they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tyre placement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 hrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car slow@@ ed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took and then stood on the roof in the green strip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four in@@ mates , two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked towards north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two opponents were against Braunschweig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to better fit in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle is to be optimised even further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a release , the Fort@@ unas no longer want to catch up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain experience , than with the four @-@ chain chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ body , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we are not doing so many ab@@ err@@ ations in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a dis@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a neat season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , because the game of Saxony had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ body and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e may even have something fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner defense of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although guests from the Rhin@@ eland , guests from the Rhin@@ eland approach the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s boss coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , Funk@@ body doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ter@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , you should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) was assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; perhaps under 18 &quot; old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said in The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noticed that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age assessment , in X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of the biological maturity of men , in order to see whether they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot certainly say it , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Transport in the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three @-@ need@@ ing bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the building is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a marginal fastening , which is also used as an operating track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide brid@@ ging cap is to be used on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines required by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach has a special finger@@ tip feeling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is also a fibre cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the work , the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated via a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of the three bel@@ fry is 700 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a guard is coming together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Stad@@ thalle invites to the poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ speakers , but demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally planned for the City picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking space below the r@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a colourful picture , which is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the chairman of the forum A world and one of the most important organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported about the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic ice , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for a cancellation in Dau@@ n , but there was not enough parking space available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the r@@ ond@@ ell , hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also does : at 8@@ pm a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , provides various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are around 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidates for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a listening to the Wolf Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Kloster Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ji &quot; meets a classic German apprenticeship with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have held various solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter in the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ horn of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both combines the desire to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the two as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; is combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ a@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating total art work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core of the program was first performed in Freiburg , with great success only this spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians , and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster Church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses , and they will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately deals with bitter@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin assured the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with everyone I have ever had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it has never been pu@@ zz@@ led or hin@@ dered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them , she suffered as &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school age as she would rather dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and he inherited a coal business from his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening that said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance , &quot; said R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics CEO D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been sn@@ apped out of gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , following a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that start on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , announced on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free , he said in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral p@@ act for soldiers rolled up in Mali
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two are commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ solved down@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she described the two reverse pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ ning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday , a week ago in West African Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , only the families in the church took leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gri@@ ev@@ ances deposited li@@ lies , the relatives standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the reverse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the headquarters of Staff Head@@ quarters have built the aircraft of the fighting helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar , and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers were , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody could have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ers were brought out of the cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , and continued to be informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be a king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired , laying down the title of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Communi@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not look equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old ultimately will be , be unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he likes the country , for which he worked in the last 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the son of a French noble family , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything was critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and the reputation of being a brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be content with this position , not ashamed of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was equal to two faults ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants a spe@@ edy re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the parliament voted on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the unexpected exit of a Green Euro MP from their state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ westen , justified its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend its Group to include it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the relationship has been reversed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Land@@ tag will be announced on January 14th , next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l is indispensable , however , that the day of the holiday decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also provides the possibility that the State Parliament draws the trust of the Prime Minister , and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be tested legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ we@@ ster@@ ne &apos;s step , &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party called for the sovereign parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her administrative report on the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chair@@ men Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was aware of no pron@@ oun@@ cement in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the resignation of S @-@ D de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U , El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Euro MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly elect the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exit of T@@ we@@ ster@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its past vanity and fru@@ stration , the politicians &quot; place their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony plays this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to persu@@ ade his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the result of the 2013 elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was in the SPD strongest force at that time , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How can we protect us from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks and answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge , and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if we know what we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the enlightened person is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation , it has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment are available to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the residual moisture content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in case of eggs , they are not market@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there only a lack of personnel , or the conclu@@ sive competence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ uting authorities in cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect an un@@ interrupted education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the acquired means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ delivering animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on all levels , it must be worked rigor@@ ously and with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all relevant authorities to clarify the facts quickly and seamlessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A because the executive organisation controlling the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules established in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with security , PS@@ G can easily make money to make N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to interact with legitimate income sources that enable them to play the break even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to ruin when banks or owners pulled back their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Plat@@ ini is dis@@ cour@@ aged by the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his latest UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years will amount to EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies , associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was set up by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup , in Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup am@@ bass@@ adors will simply be able to find out such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to bear in mind every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros , with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership stake in PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La Liga against a state that finances an association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair , because you can pursue different paths or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , chocolate has made Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard @-@ Cho@@ col@@ ate for the Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the official cooperation is in front of a possible ending : the airline re@@ writes the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request of the News Agency , confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years , and subjected to a quality control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ cking boards distribute to 14 grams per year , the flight atten@@ dant before landing to the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many applicants , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only Swiss producers come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and a half years ago , Swiss launched the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are spo@@ ilt by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ uns Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also distributed on the short circuit by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympic Champion Robert Har@@ ting wins World Cup final
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , the triple World Champion will compete for a medal on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , failed in the national championship race and could only look at the Tri@@ bun@@ e competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meters far , qualified for the final battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ able era permanent memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for an attractive jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play great children who are grown up , yet they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; with his grown @-@ ups that now play adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy is more based on the pedi@@ gre@@ es principle including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sw@@ ells the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character viol@@ ates an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is particularly fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lower lip from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans &quot; in the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the 1980 &apos;s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ en@@ J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , like Americans might do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of the famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë , Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de out &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was re@@ arranged to a smaller length because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef could always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the communist audience , which is imag@@ ining , is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ser@@ mon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong , we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age , and arrest warran@@ ts issued against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , officials ordered larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , German arrest warran@@ ts were issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the two are probably shipped to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of the Ma@@ fia are accused of drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office for comb@@ ating drug trafficking has been established in Southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the public prosec@@ utor in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an active exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the great deal was accompanied by four servants from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Italian citizens with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia declined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang &apos;s account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
way Indi@@ c@@ ates large gaps in the foreign register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigration register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Register records ten million people with foreign nationality , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , the data is administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data were not maintained sufficiently , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer exist in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who wouldn &apos;t have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false classi@@ fications , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , the paper says that the &apos; BA@@ MF &apos; lead such proceedings in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible for the newspaper to refer to the difficult situation on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful entrance conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation service to other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shares 50 liters of blood with its 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the municipal council traditionally acknow@@ le@@ dges the multi@@ fold willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are created for this and we pay attention to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the round@@ table leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , corn makers reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of atten@@ de@@ es a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were awarded several donated blood donations for each donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mer , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave away 10 times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ed speculation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish , when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and anticipated the pressure on budget@@ ary income in 2017 , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to rein the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that lending would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with £ 115 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year , and another in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases should be gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year will be compared with the 1,@@ 9 % and 1.7 % expected in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after these messages , the pound fell to the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened rising expectations of interest rate and the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight increase in wages , as the sharpen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not prevent the in@@ comes from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts are notic@@ eably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will take four years , until this will complete the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Over@@ write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent rate of swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as the credi@@ tors would like to quit business and end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with roy@@ alty @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with con@@ ten@@ tious HIV drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September onwards , patients will receive a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that before the sexual intercourse , pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such medications can be taken every day , or so , two hours before sexual intercourse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those who come into question for treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appropriate participants are identified in hospitals , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and registered with a family doctor , can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sexual clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study is intended to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale , absorbed and implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of sustained progress in managing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted towards patients who are vulnerable and vulnerable , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hesit@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country in order to protect individuals who are HIV infection , and that it will help us to step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sought something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to make the generous covering height optimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architects and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ hed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to function longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit of engineering went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional tie in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can turn into something quite astonishing , through good design and increased square footage of something standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of Vic@@ tori@@ as the largest property imperialist in the value of over 500 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers gathered 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , West@@ co &apos;s family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now encompasses offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with their deceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a judicial file states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Paul , the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ rais@@ als proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it presented by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in says that he started in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark had paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in was very reluct@@ ant , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L , and after a biography of 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied via SMS , to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to take our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have tried , and failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to cur@@ b the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - hoping to hold the boss on a regular course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with leading employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the president &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of jobs that were to be convincing , &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to holding tr@@ ump t@@ witter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s t@@ witter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others , that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have had more combus@@ tible products without their interventions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees managed to keep away from him several times , their efforts paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king junk controversy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties , repeatedly attempt to present their own agenda by presenting g@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co - dealing with this story - in May , reported on the preference of advis@@ ers to the president for strategic reasons doub@@ t@@ ful information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an example , described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he gets to know wh@@ ence they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly that happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be the source behind a pile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article , and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the Recy@@ cle Bin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe he will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this summer , the police all over Europe ( virtual ) post@@ cards are sent to dangerous criminals on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals naturally are not known , references from the population will be collected and requested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol talked about the action followed by the winter in the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting places hide on holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online viewers could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to notices after publication on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travellers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Number &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ ef@@ oot , which have negotiated a tren@@ ch from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had only been thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense systems , and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the angry inhabitants have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local charge , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who did not want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents get an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by invo@@ king 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the judgment must check , when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is coming from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to open on March 1 , next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Ambi@@ ence Company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues were also recorded by the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan , to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old baths removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the facilities include a swimming pool , a wellness area and a meeting room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one would not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when asked about the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outdoor spaces are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open from the restaurant open to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Agent op@@ ts Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russia affair with U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Board of Directors has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on familiar persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first invitations to the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son , and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump , Ele@@ ction team and Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation will focus on several men who , in the election campaign , acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ umps in private and business environments under the microscope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the center and investigating whether the president could obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible crime incidents and to decide whether charges should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called the dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the body can be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to interro@@ gate under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. too , Tr@@ ump counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure shows that Mu@@ eller should not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work , and that if necessary , he should act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the inaugur@@ ation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump &apos;s concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this work also usually works in secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used after having fired Com@@ ey , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this alle@@ gation , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had been loud , he had hin@@ dered the justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said before a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair with the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the president &apos;s margins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several trans@@ formers of both parties , however , want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the bill of law on Thursday , after which the Special Agent could no longer be easily dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ice mountain driving Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has developed from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s just seven times the size of Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer , is now driving north and will need two , three years until it has melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger for people , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent the climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ic@@ e@@ berg , it is unclear after research data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , however , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of ice cre@@ ams in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the broken col@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America , almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North of this ice shelf , the balance of growth and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete scrap of scrap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C file is in danger , as the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece is breaking off at a key station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the melting of ice @-@ ice and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it flows after the melting itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in the Antar@@ ctic , with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , it breaks regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and is aware of no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or fall back in the long term , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though these researchers did not decrease the breakdown of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ice cre@@ w@@ ls of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ car@@ ded over the past few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus number to the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U wants to rate house rate at staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U wants to exit from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the summer break , the circular day opened 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the administrative administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circles around the circle seem to be much sought after .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , approximately 6@@ 20 applications were to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the group lacks personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places around M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , wants to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs in skilled workers , but also to counter@@ act the future oriented job shortage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented inside and out , demonstrating concrete measures for career star@@ ters and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sounds like a good approach , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one did not know in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees , offering more attractive conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service for disease or age @-@ related reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so high time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Daniel@@ s , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he long ago took care of a fau@@ st @-@ thick surprise in the circle , when he publicly challenged personnel costs and ba@@ ff@@ led the remaining parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable the withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ ur@@ ly tariff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and civil servants more than the tariff for the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sal@@ aries are currently prescribed by law , increases or more money is only when one changes to a higher level , oriented towards professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ uting law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they too have too little staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers who facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express an appeal by the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alle@@ gations currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is suspected that its crew is carrying out din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least such a meeting occurred only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown over the authority of the Italian coast guard , rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not out of any other motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization ( MS@@ F ) is a Nobel Peace Prize winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ es@@ ota said in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants to be able to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ sen@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Gu@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out was at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers found healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga stands for e @-@ sport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium of wind and weather ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga clubs that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning was made by V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Federation held the first &apos; Interactive Club World Cup &apos; in London , where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent electric athletes under the contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga team to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will be challenged at a competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual sport has long ago established li@@ gen , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for Asi@@ ans , E @-@ sport is already a part of the official programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but is it a real sport , anyway ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , In@@ go F@@ rob@@ at has dealt with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports such as increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ at also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are on the international way , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three years , sales are expected to rise to 130 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te advis@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the U.S. Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ ver inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport betting providers Uni@@ kr@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and France , the So@@ ccer League clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is not enough today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company in the modern market at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that everything stays the way it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ven@@ om eggs ade - E@@ gg alternatives for cooking , baking and baking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states are affected by the scandal about pois@@ oned eggs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and all eggs are sold throughout Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regi@@ ments only eggs should be taken , which are demonstr@@ ably not included in Fi@@ pron@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy for suicide push for suicide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s negli@@ gent killing , which took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was sentenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her age or maturity or mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was &quot; no day when I did not get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I was together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang yourself , hop from a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was paid by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x belonged to her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to perform at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern tr@@ umps the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something else was different on his cabin in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush attached to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer didn &apos;t tell it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the stand could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sign of the coach could point Kim@@ me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and straight out of their vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of all , sugar is distributed to those who want to trust a lot that you want to keep in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are chosen to take part in L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s legacy , you can use a little extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped into the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the right rear , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Kim@@ i took part in this initial formation , like the one who can best take the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated trou@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had a look to the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so V@@ idal &apos;s inability to persu@@ ade his missing fitness , ren@@ ato san@@ ches to connect to the performance of the Asia trip ( also limited only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not have a negative impact on their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , this worked out very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet was running beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nam@@ eless Nap@@ oli assault was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a few times in the re@@ building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also showed a decent performance in the debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ me said goodbye after a few crisp statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Damen
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ F@@ B ladies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ ball@@ ers , just before the game , reported on Twitter and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck , and with our La@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motiv@@ ational sp@@ lash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps our ladies might need the famous Bayern @-@ Shower , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ oric Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ elli Tempo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy on T V demand , and at the same time imp@@ ec@@ cable the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , president of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing addresses the wishes of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planned phase of planning until 2021 is expected to be right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ road Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Ministeri@@ al Spe@@ aker Cornelia Hol@@ tmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ us sees it as a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims as a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own business , and praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new Master Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates do become independent within ten years after the master training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to set up Wis@@ sing in the regional operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Industry requires , to award more orders to external offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the invoice , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads than proposed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating internet connections and dis@@ bur@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics , and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi is to change over 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and it appealed to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens , and may cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alisation of the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of scor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ shut@@ ters to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but re@@ trac@@ ted under normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the study might heavily pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen , the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message has the raft on Saturday , on the Is@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who prefers to go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , who will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , the construction paper wants to clarify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of an publicity campaign , to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy wild river is to be sharpen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and laughter against the suffering
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the n@@ oll@@ n@@ ases of his figures are his trademark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still records and works on a film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish Im@@ migrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which makes him frustr@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to find its dro@@ l@@ lic figures worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the protag@@ onist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los loved any animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as a counterpart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film will talk to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is reproduced without wor@@ dless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , giving scientists and farmers trying to find solutions that cause major headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively exposed because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change and much more in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is much in the game , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town of Gei@@ sha , in Thurin@@ gia , is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medium @-@ age firm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries or a Land War@@ ehouse are to be experienced on these days in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the Sin@@ alo@@ a State through organised crime , corrupt officials and perpet@@ ual drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was told , that it is important to change their routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the list of criminals or car@@ tels , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no rest of the violence , and while the bodies of bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists have been in charge . 5@@ 89 have been under federal protection for at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been in seven countries this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the latter is the publisher and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s ; Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wearing t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , her night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely challenged by journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ consol@@ ate and although the ground is still tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ z in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was fired from his car , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sho@@ oter drove away in his car , and damaged it nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in the United States last year , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ d , broke with his guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival monopoli@@ es in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , susp@@ ects gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars to shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; It was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porters loved to publish heavily imp@@ acting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it was leading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ Y award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task of being a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ us team missed Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n @-@ bird , who could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , Was his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best , and to stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it smells false , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ d Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing has happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days prior to it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ an in a four @-@ storey building , located in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself described as being un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are actually under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce has shown three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was murder of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that dominated all the political levels almost all the century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months earlier , the readers could have viewed Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists became lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , accused journalists and killed them because they told the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has since asked that she is assigned again by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the T@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of its director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug car@@ tels with a leading article on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists fled from their own countries , or even from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was assass@@ inated three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking frigh@@ tens him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to h@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the ker@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ z on mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped guard , to see if they were ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible all over Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce followed his traces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day Ja@@ vier had asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown , and they said she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; referred to it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er living in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has astonished researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ an@@ kles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blin@@ dly b@@ link with your eyes , you could almost believe it was sleeping , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is likely to be threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ preservation which is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say what hin@@ ders that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er made head@@ lines for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted enough pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powerful predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the cra@@ dle time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to study the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he fell on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ y ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which were ra@@ ided by his shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant e@@ ater was swept through the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin rests still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I watch it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ tery at A@@ 8 : many wounded
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : scarcely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres @-@ long staff@@ s - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass strike at the late afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , at 5 p.m. between the junction points Adel@@ fen@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including trucks , were probably inter@@ connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the exact number of the injured was not indic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was light to moderate injuries , a police spokesman said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident site , a large number of ambul@@ ance vehicles were required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of travel Munich , a approximately ten kilometres of retro@@ sp@@ ection was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , there was also a large number of G@@ aff@@ er on the back road to massive disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire department listed the characteristics of the vehicle operators , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : the company is testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing clu@@ es , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or one is deep@@ ened in his work , and has just a brilliant idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the creator and w@@ akes an uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ able , or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , the Deutsche Bahn is testing the automatic ticket control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply confirm by phone , that you take your seat and invali@@ date the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a test operation runs on two tracks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket invali@@ dity without any conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use this , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to book an online ticket , which already does most passengers anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also necessary to purchase it via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , a seat reservation is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climbs in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their mobile devices , the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seats Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the train ticket inspec@@ tor comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting with an already paid online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can therefore continue to sleep , work on and keep silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you travel often , you know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket checks are among the greatest offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often one has , but in any case one of the companions do not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the credit card or the ID card is missing , or otherwise a document that needs to be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or big room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but death was nothing new to them , and their community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stopped her cell phone , to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who had a sign saying : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman ass@@ ures his ri@@ fle and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people &apos;s point of view and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation , which she had innumerable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must know it , and it must be seen and raised in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a disgu@@ sting racism , she is no different than the next black woman child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South of Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by many cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project nearer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the in@@ humanity of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ lip @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black Germany Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the whole movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; chosen by Fer@@ rel@@ l as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , even though it was in front of the front , because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the intelligence cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years , because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home , &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it has not been built for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone sp@@ li@@ ts the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , &quot; Does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery pul@@ ls more customers into the city , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost weekly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the rural women again and again very gladly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other cities , there is also that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping column in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I don &apos;t think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , there is enough in our town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see , how many stores here are empty here - some for months and years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is also reasonably priced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not acceptable for a retailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty stores there is almost no more and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes sometime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it already create the ghost bit gallery , before selling all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , no one needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a farmers market hall , give it no more space thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the farming market is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair clips that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the clips from the prison Fort Le@@ ave to where the former intelligence service Analy@@ st gave a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publi@@ ci@@ zed diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was unified in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , when he had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like a man using these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also for identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie where Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette stu@@ ff@@ ing and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal pen@@ alties , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a cartoon by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ ub was to be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few days after the book was published , Obama &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome sort of happy meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also some deep and heavy rain at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to further develop the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , her video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she shows up with a hands @-@ free speech in the hands of the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford , for murder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a nationwide human race is under way for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed away after several counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the counts as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that they now have been in a review and were excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the relevant authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson from the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ators in any conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added , that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he was pressing the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 100@@ 8 something happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and war@@ locks were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria listed on the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have publicly accepted the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with Russian sales outlet at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have reiter@@ ated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has prior to accepting this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
this divided the company groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health draw@@ back , it was stated in the communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested demonstr@@ ably neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency with his customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ ups , which will help your company not become the next U@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has called people from the outside , for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the increase , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , allow employees anonym@@ ity and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and direct themselves to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows which units have the most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so you can drill down why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post in which those who have spoken have been punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a company is found that beha@@ ves poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have a simple way to reach their headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the company Con@@ ver@@ cent is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Commit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical breach of the En@@ ron scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and pol@@ lu@@ te the company with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of firms such as S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 10 million in November secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets like Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are stak@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data on employee engagement is important in the workplace culture experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4.000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen too much about collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , staff will ask &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you worry about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem was reported by G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this results in a better bond of employees in a sector known for high turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts at 11 p.m. , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have stri@@ pped their tri@@ cot tops , showing the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the 3 hour exercise , before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 before starting formal games preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M , in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many different routes of the player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pressed it , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the Camp ends , which is not an easy task , given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to draw up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I don &apos;t worry too much about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports to third party fak@@ ers and their results below the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the Company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fact test@@ ers that may show results of the fact test from the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany does not support them to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check will be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related articles , &quot; and work on other changes to his / her news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cosy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des - a cosmop@@ olitan city shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith and William Ex@@ ley . Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; - a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb expression !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters still smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted cup@@ olas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape gather@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards representing what owned , &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go your way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe , the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ ys his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men redeemed their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ out experiences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ nig , the grounds of a san@@ atorium built in the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coating of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their website un@@ folded yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid five @-@ digit amount , and the campaign costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ers and promotions at the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , a normal operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Government , the five Vice @-@ Offic@@ ers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military , the government attracts the re@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the Movement of Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who allegedly participated directly at the coup attempt , Ankara is negotiating this week in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as a &quot; god present , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the major suit in the army and the security forces continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan issued a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 coup d &quot; é@@ tat , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; formerly , the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , they were calling on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan has pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say , Erdo@@ gan has targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt , was seeking asylum in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , NATO could not let Nato be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , in the alliance with the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness for the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington alters the Green Card rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more stringent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and visa restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by paying the way to citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate distance for ski lift
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , over the past few months has passed over the future of the rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les - it is now to go very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , there is to be built on the margin on which the Tourist Railway runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the rac@@ er sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , there will be construction work on the route following the Ministry of Transport this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ weg path , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Transportation State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at approximately 2,5 million euros , the cost of maintenance of the route was estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this sum , the country is 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , is currently fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry and the southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the racing bike Shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rac@@ er shuttle is a rail link , specially popular among tourists , between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , the course of a pilot plant has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them again in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the route is in parts strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , indeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his convi@@ ctions , selecting everything from the color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robot to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usion to rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R has noticed their increasing popularity , they are nonetheless pro@@ vision@@ ally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the fr@@ inge zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives them permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has helped women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the secre@@ tive body and the eye @-@ po@@ ked eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot separate themselves from their companion , or simply go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , to express it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : ma@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , have also split families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to handle the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all re@@ port@@ edly strain all of us to burst our filter bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less noticed , the power Tr@@ ump is to bring together families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ leaning den@@ ser who lives in Chicago and has long engaged with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited New York this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but I also notice that it also involves considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the liber@@ ating effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his kit@@ tens will not be thrown away one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing norm@@ alize , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reasoning in comparison to his standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be considered very mild criminal off@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ five years later and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Central Park Car@@ ousel is still an odd magical experience , since two years of age , an eleven @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; on a scale of one to five stars this week before I was able to pass through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year he was transferred to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , taking it several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the fourth @-@ class pupils were released from caps and el@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , three of the students will go to the secondary high school , four at the secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te School Director welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a symbol for school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the m@@ lower ar conducted a musical with the title &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it apart from his chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young animal is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wished each four @-@ leg@@ ged sler , that he felt accepted in his new school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by a thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always comes up with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks and the parent representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time of the kitchen is over , the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ blade chan@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight first grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ iting from television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia a group of illeg@@ ally ro@@ ving people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were released later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry said , that the court may impose a fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in this promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emission performance of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 diesel engines , or worse , are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the new promotion mandatory ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no . the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schum@@ an Software &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their retro@@ fit , the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) has ordered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet called a precise date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler advised to write about every affected person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled within the framework . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long should the conver@@ sions go , overall ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship depends on manufacturers &quot; commitment and political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could take only three to four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time @-@ consuming , it could be to get an appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ ce advises to wait .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is there a risk of a massive decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even in the regions , where driving b@@ ans are threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ACE reveals , with a sale still to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) became the honored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and will take part in the award ceremony with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that he had to refrain from taking part in the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that weighs heavily on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will take advantage of the conversation with ump , to clarify their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Buil@@ der , retired in R@@ ente next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he teaches in the press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks that await his success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , it is at the same time that no application satis@@ fies the requirements profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest possible date , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in compliance with the regular notice periods , it should be enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ contractor for the administrative community , the applicant has to present appropriate certificates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this function wants to keep the city in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they could no longer fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good working climate as well as a good mood between authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the chi@@ pper with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will spend some 1.5 million euros in a book , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of design , there is ample room for a city builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many people can react very flexibly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city builder emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , the city master has a high responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( building ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , you should have completed academic studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Building Authority is responsible for civil engineering , construction management , under@@ mining matters , administrative buildings and urban landsc@@ ap@@ ers , as well as underground building rights authorities , including preservation of historic monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bicycle thrown on lines : South track blocked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were severely damaged , so that the approaching freight train had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the scene , a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; é@@ tat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetrators , would have brought in great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delayed minutes and the costs of rail replacement , the train customers could also get to the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the spokesman said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern run@@ way could be guided without disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of which were inter@@ viewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains were not falling , but they delayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US , and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Washington University , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna said that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide inside the food cannot penetrate the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells capable of det@@ aching inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging delicate tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it was noted that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also hosts people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell which found tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribal , which was separately housed , did not have this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suspected that the difference with the micro@@ bial chromos@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mice were treated in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers investigated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active component of the liquid has been puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L rep@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potential tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic wrote a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday began and impressed itself as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues had been excluded and only made 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u entered the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start XI for the start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three other new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to U.S. State Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing already had such commerci@@ als earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new fence for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was even SPD boss , S &amp; D prime minister always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only no fire from the party centre , just no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with growing terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition co@@ ali@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of S &amp; D Euro MPs pushed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the dark @-@ Saxon Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen has to give back her mandate , &quot; said the German executive and election leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an SPD elec@@ tor , when Friday morning finally reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , faces the CD@@ U without any government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and no one knows what will happen next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades re@@ treated his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it became - and indeed , everything was significantly worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cleaned the party smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weeks after , the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ti@@ pped up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with him , the next blow came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in the crisis communications , he did everything wrong afterwards , which can be done wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the League in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attempt of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , was not concealed by Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let him grant him , as they promised a stabilization of the party by Wei@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the absurd Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Mr@@ s T@@ westen places their own career negotiations on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but on the Landes@@ bank of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the votes four years ago were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on to clarify the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there have been more , or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding money for city centre III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like to rehabili@@ tate his house in the years , will soon be able to get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg &apos;s urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1991 , there is state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art refur@@ bish@@ ment areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project . &quot; finally , it is important to further develop the inner development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest from the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ in@@ dler continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it also plays a role whether there is interest in the planned territory to refur@@ b@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the area boundaries could then be shifted again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the restructuring would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be related to objects , i.e. , per plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a statute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1 January 2017 , the grants period for the grants will continue until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September this year the inventory will be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the set will be set up as soon as possible so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that each commun@@ e must carry out the said pre @-@ examinations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about evaluating the urban development and deciding when to renov@@ ate and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the respective property , it will also be included in the basic book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations himself and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it concerns the construc@@ tional condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arc , &quot; information about the size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operating Stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if commercial premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first , advises first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , some photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip , in order to come with a hand movement in house and car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip , and takes only 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter for an event that lifts American production last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , which has been left to TI@@ ME Magazin up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter car made from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft , the helicopter was produced in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South of La@@ wn , according to the records of the helicopter Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the records made available by the TI@@ ME were not clear , whether a second flight crew was required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could harm the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President is obliged to use them for the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump performed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports describing the use of the presidential jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often conduct training flights around Washington and the South of La@@ wn , in order to deal with precise centimet@@ res in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a jump at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event numbered the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units flew in addition 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain any budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the member states of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records of Un@@ ity list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Pod@@ casts , Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn of the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ gade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump talked to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top of the Second Tennis division , S@@ V is the leader in the third tennis league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel , the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss works at the stand@@ ings third S@@ V in Kiel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V , the imports from the high North ensure above all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to betting in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ sch@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently active in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won his first stake in this season at the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ casts was on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ a , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can hurt O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature under the law on the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft proposed to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ funded with other European companies , have contributed to the construction of the Russian East Stream North Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dro@@ h@@ ku@@ lis@@ se is tremendous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could ward off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the Hitler series of Net@@ fli@@ x moved to the center
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is far from over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest performance of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i car@@ tel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as a Fort@@ une 500 company with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) commands the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ole backwards : the town has 46 kitchen aids
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table , itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with permanent contact persons for the children , and assignment to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town &apos;s day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head in the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooked is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers fresh cooked co@@ ols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 nur@@ series , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last litter year , 2@@ 800 children were seated at the tables and the need grows continuously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for 45 days of the week , have lunch at the day@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have food service from 1 September : they heat the supplied food , supplement them with salads , raw foods and fruits , divide the meal individually , drain , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a cab@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , too : healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this continuity is important for the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now , also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen , has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in comparison to the city as the most economical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours have not so much weight at about 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible , if women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have published threats against an election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tili@@ ties to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections for the first time will pass the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ some said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
walk to the TV @-@ anniversary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the occasion of the 110 year anniversary , the TV Kaiser@@ ingen invites you to a small hike with subsequent coffee and cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hike starts on Sunday , July 9th , at 13 o &apos;clock in Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten of the water reservoir in the U.S. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there it goes to the airport , to the Nat@@ ter and back to the reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hike takes about one and a half hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there will be coffee , cakes , cool drinks , str@@ ing@@ ed saus@@ ages and cheese in Kaiser@@ ingen in the school house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who need to take a ride from Kaiser@@ ingen to Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten , Germany : the meeting point is in Kaiser@@ ingen at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men attempt to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young men aged 19 and 23 , trying to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police information , the men asked the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ ch@@ ing@@ straße , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused , however , and went on with her friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a loo@@ t , the duo fled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the two young men could be arrested by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation is underway .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production in its plant in Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company kept silent on the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500 people work in the plant , which in addition to other products Hob@@ bes and R@@ ich Tea makes bis@@ cuits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vic@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; express concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the large @-@ region Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager near T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our business processes change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ gio returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is always a source near the Catal@@ ans mind that the club has always done his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players sign up , they will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereas the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday night , a well @-@ known perpetr@@ ator was deliberately thrown out of the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , causing damage to over 200 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he was driving a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ chi@@ ed the guiding line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the crossing of Stol@@ zen@@ au a passenger car came to him in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an rider tou@@ ted the guiding line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
damage to the car was caused by material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the accident driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are now asking for witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the prisoner &apos;s vehicle to get in touch with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret on their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that in reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee may be conspic@@ uous with regard to the attacks in Regensburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria from Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a very normal educational tool to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often di@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote to R@@ atz@@ inger the memorial book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ sian , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly is in the 4@@ 40 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg , Germany ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of grab@@ s . 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are sexually ab@@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , concludes : &quot; in summary it can be said that by master cap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially with a high degree of emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be severe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , contrary to many other accused , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , can even associate positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann : the 4@@ 40 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence exercise in the &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it appears also as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ cs and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able when a dom@@ eter didn &apos;t bring a top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 4@@ 40 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity in the horrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , too , ex@@ propri@@ ated outside its sphere of influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at best , one can pre@@ tend to experience it too late or not have taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s great majority , a very good @-@ looking teacher , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which also sometimes lead to qu@@ arri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not only throw chairs on the floor and threw the keys on the ground , but also gave ear cow@@ ards and che@@ ek@@ y boys to the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such methods of education in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread among parents and teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also lived in a secular school , a high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the abuse of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are indeed dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one wonders whether it &apos;s not about his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working dili@@ gently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is , the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger have also placed any involvement or co @-@ operation regarding sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have committed themselves to the cath@@ et@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a cho@@ ir@@ master who would have been a colleague of the offen@@ ders professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger play a role with regard to the abuse of mis@@ use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student stated that &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he had had timely knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is absurd to assume that it is presum@@ ed that ... box@@ ers intru@@ sive or clearer or more likely to have opened , than against their parents , dormit@@ ories , trust teachers etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear outcome : &quot; in the course of the investigation concerned students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to an ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up its good name with these contradictory crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ ner View &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the report considers incidents from time since 1945 , even for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ spar@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were deliberately mis@@ placed and mal@@ igned themselves , were all confis@@ cated at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did not have anything to do , because he got the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ litter gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; elementary school &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment , and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ sch@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a certain degree of discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be stolen away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the operations at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back around 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger follow the ears consistently ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ sch@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um who even reproduced the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing sentences were also long banned in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , they took possession of a legal grey zone , as each of us knows well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected persons might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s just not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis claimed , it was unfair to apply the current educational standards to the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princess has already been right there , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resist@@ ors and violence against innocent pra@@ w@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful , and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all of this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so dress the ears and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a physical punishment , it was strictly forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has represented Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also available for language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I do not mean by any means that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to go on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , un@@ ru@@ ly boys can no longer stand a great singer and in front of every success whatever field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , during talks with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond that , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , found@@ ational , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly get how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tation , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have not forgiven him until now , that he was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , most of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strong father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for which she is still looking at and ad@@ mon@@ ishing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clearly : all you have to do is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the state would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one probably knew the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen to finally settle in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
