28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and the investigation was underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joining his family was to always bring us something to cook , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the brother , who swa@@ m with the stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining every day , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has information about the case , is asked to call the Hin@@ o@@ stel@@ st@@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview , the Hollywood star has now made a clear mistake in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are more simple to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , pre tv with relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film runs with us starting on August 25 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photo purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a small gala , German sporting aid presented the Golden Sport@@ pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of awards to the like@@ able athlete , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ rel leaf , Champion @-@ Tour player of the year ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sport pyramid is long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only given for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t - the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be - Alexander Pus@@ hing and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t - the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke - the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball of Er@@ hard Wonder@@ s .
many of these sports le@@ agues had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company im@@ migr@@ ated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza award ran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential competitors are at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state , over the role of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ drive regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open up advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , party internal discussions could be made on Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants , and re @-@ ride coal mining in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , plans to extend and demand the renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , they both want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better , for instance , Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump does in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says , he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is trying to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost back to everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a large kitchen , four women sit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each has a baby , which is only one year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has put her little son in her arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with big eyes , he looks curi@@ ously into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is a business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social assistance services in Bavaria , and focuses on women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are chi@@ ckens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they live in the north of Munich , one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has opened up the organisation together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 people live there , about 40 women and 20 children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no men , neither as visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ als secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their home they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , bra@@ ins , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the escape , this continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , B@@ ahr tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here again , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to the fact that around 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ sed , appreciate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , many women are so accustomed to say nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what I experienced because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich , some with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not separated , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ woman of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are several common ground floors or own houses for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or will men and women stay together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need for protection , it is possible to read on the crowds that there is on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
resident doctors argue : demands for new work competition measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new work competition measures , in relation to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in favour of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; to problems , which led to the conclusion that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations to all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting in early September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , head of the BM@@ A Assistance Force , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreement agreed by the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance doctors and medical students that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be compulsory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands , announ@@ cing an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pping , and it barely radi@@ ated heat , even for its restrained relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the c@@ ousin is difficult , if not impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after spending last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat , almost his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ l formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is angry with the West , because it looks at its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ped to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara ensuring that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that reject and badly treat themselves from the West , and now join them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents announced at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member threw Turkey off the Russian battle jet , it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bank &apos;s chief executive , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Bank has dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Victor Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , it has decided to put more national brands into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references are transferred to Nat@@ West &apos;s de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other smaller brands for private customers that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals but to pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of brands because how do we focus on the internal ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , when we said that we would have been a great bench for our customers and launched these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think that you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3@@ 000@@ th gain in New@@ market &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in the new market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he seated on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened to new@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am relieved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he picks up the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career ie@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma excited fans for years for this sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had picked up 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of British flat race for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his funeral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least five years of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin fire chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence of Putin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al of his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a substitute for Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Krem@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin informed Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do the smiling faces convince you ?
Moscow has en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin , working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men declared that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the ridi@@ culous for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , is the result of a kind of power struggle ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once tou@@ red as a potential president , would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - b@@ ump@@ ed into great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you might almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his substitute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his resignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the set , it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart blood , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans for a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puzzles for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about the 75 fish around Sand@@ als , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 , a £ 1.@@ 35 billion project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted cables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is planned to be completed by May 2017 , a £ 1.@@ 35 billion project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the building site for a visit and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire deck deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is fitted today in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this fantastic project , the closure represents trend @-@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the North tower in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or the country side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a massive , and at the same time very delicate activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delicate , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and turned to the worst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the manager of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop , but it was released by the person who controlled the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , someone has watched over these men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; badly injured - man bites his ex @-@ girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetrators cut down the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came to the tabernacle , he stab@@ bed it twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand , and in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a consequence , this al@@ armed his sister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street , she met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old opened his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds up favorable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should become much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one react to the bad news that in the next few years , Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big dispute in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing construction funding programme , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be funded , is intended to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as viol@@ a : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as little as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of that , such as viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear , whether we will get the skilled workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the program is not yet complete : because the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how to compensate for the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the coming years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , foreign policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West@@ stadt , the end of the year will exp@@ ire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1800 apartments , one could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West City is dramatically increased again , the aim of so @-@ called mixing is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city , should not be given any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens anticipate that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does not mean , however , that a compromise cannot yet be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that te@@ ens and kid do not go outside to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , was compla@@ ined in the last decade of many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently reported that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , it only sees the raw data to increase performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take 30 minutes to get active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active each day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people looking miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do sports regularly , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ics that always complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Smartphone Apps such as Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its charm , and the use will be recre@@ ated with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ é@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now finally , also Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast en@@ cl@@ ed the title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American women of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es are on the swing during the single multi @-@ war competition of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman winning a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she broke into tears when her end result was shown , and her long journey at that moment took an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the former team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of their floor exercises - which include their typical tum@@ bling pass , is tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not accidental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school departure in the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was leading through two turns , the picture clou@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swe@@ be@@ beam and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nes - in which Bil@@ es hold the world title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and finished with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her sof@@ tly when they expected her permission - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their land exercise , she cast k@@ us@@ h@@ hands to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police : 3 victims killed in mass murder , while listening to music in the car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is able to read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , because the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the polic@@ eman of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic homes within four months and two others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence , which led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car , and listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also released a police report about the shooting , which was reduced to an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the factory of serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sco@@ op out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like least of his age , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wher@@ eu@@ pon , I did not let myself down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t talk .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle ride .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Give me something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund , alone , invented a few characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the a@@ ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , how it will affect the life of the infected with the ci@@ a@@ virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she still doesn &apos;t know , still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the a@@ ic@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , it will become better for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for emergency , on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state officials have been in constant contact with local authorities and have already been on the road to help the communities concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said that , alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flood warning system is used over long parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , to Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather service decre@@ ed that , in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River A@@ mite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue teams are still associated with floo@@ ding in the district of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son , southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by the bell on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increased overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step son , who lives nearby , warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford said she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ bers , where they were accommodated to the Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood had spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since there were still heavy rainf@@ all and that the authorities might consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr K@@ rau@@ tmann said that since Wednesday , the ground was completely absorbed by rainf@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom failure in five school districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ F , reported that there were 200 surviving houses flooded in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were now flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the towns of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , shel@@ ters were set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back into their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the high water , which hope to keep the water from their homes and stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy told Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys that it was ra@@ ining along the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but no reports were announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sur@@ gery in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was covered with bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with , that it is expected to recover again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should have started the first class , in a local elementary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown was one of four , who were shot at German@@ town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia , in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reports the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cartridge sleeves for storm ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , showed the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were seals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; police station officer Anthony Gin@@ sen@@ di told the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were also several houses and vehicles in the area , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ covers , and the police are still looking for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns , and that for more than one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everybody proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this team reflects the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last four years , the number one was a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman among the female gym@@ n@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and the USA che@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but it does not look like gymnas@@ tics in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gym@@ na@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymnas@@ tics primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for coaches and their families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority of these sports clubs are in prosp@@ erous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner gets their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to be inspired by countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gym . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my gym@@ n@@ astic of 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health , as well as for academic and professional success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team square and thank you to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes , after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for election rejected him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend schedules in order to improve the maintenance of the scheduled clock times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ tees for assistance doctors said last night in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors said serious concerns about the proposed agreement , particularly that it is the current financial crisis and it is to be administered to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of BM@@ A to resolve disputes met with the government to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was what Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t did last month , that his door would always be open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the penetration and appeal to the doctors &quot; concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the resident doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out other work conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to grant doctors coverage on the strike chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes , by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians , who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS , urged the assistant doctors to end the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work competition measures do not achieve anything but burdens already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and help patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , need and break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the assistant of the resident doctors and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries to the concerns concerning tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health as regards adher@@ ence to agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce heart risk risk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake , to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake , to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls causing plaque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots which c@@ logged blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons who had already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience shows that , in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is restricted to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture causes election fraud to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed from office last year , due to corruption from office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , like a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ uses the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; abuse of eth@@ ni@@ es and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a card , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er only has to call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they leave their vote to prevent someone twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he claims that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to protect electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial culture that comes with it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street , as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in East London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ ry should be dismissed after a lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he would have put his critics into silence with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which one person el@@ ects someone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of outs to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its report it states that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Alban@@ ian background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such a behavior on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election index to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider options to ask voters in advance of choice , depending on your ID . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists edit complete envel@@ opes and envel@@ opes of letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs , to set up elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of law , which made an indictment easier for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requirement , that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters are on their own in the election cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case , no criminal charges were placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices declared un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ti@@ cking checks &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mad after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be over the French bicycle activ@@ ist Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has turned out to be an impressive double @-@ sister of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this summer , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only athlete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces running on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hunter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Kate &apos;s twin sister on the bicycle race track , many people in the internet pointed out how a certain Bow@@ man could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y resem@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any big simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as a double @-@ sister for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version , &quot; of the inc@@ eption act@@ ress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while American Adrian Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to equ@@ ate an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : football star hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others like the simil@@ arities , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory in space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nes Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; like M@@ ief , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he placed his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS , was able to say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , as from M@@ ief , he died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spectators all over Canada re@@ acted quickly , after they were shocked by the tone and the language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane T@@ we@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ is from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many people were talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back , when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow . # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you represent the C@@ BC and Canada , and makes us look like c@@ assi@@ sts . # cli@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , was live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comments about a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ ald via Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other t@@ witter users who had compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly , and issued a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriately and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ respect was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sam@@ pled under sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try pants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked out , pulled her off and put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they continued to browse and tried four pairs of speakers in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she left her and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own bush trousers and pants and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , drew up and went out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who , under circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how strange to think that someone would take home trousers which had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and she did not get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Pri@@ mark spokesperson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday 9th of August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ew@@ er around for your smo@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re approaching from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ ers and get out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your foref@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free ell@@ bow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat him then with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the att@@ acker is bent before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while taking the weapon on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and put the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , remember that at a rob@@ bery it is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - if you are not a Grand@@ master Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to lick the pur@@ ge button of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , nothing left what he cli@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his performer by travelling through the world , and eating wonderful things as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public funds to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task definitely put down its immune system under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he was able to live up to his reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his trial score displayed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4,000 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to dock after its lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had said some of the things I had instructed him to lick , just like the ec@@ el@@ ful Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to take Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ social family destroyed Del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a dele@@ tion of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ done and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their homes , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls had g@@ aping holes , wood plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family were res@@ ett@@ led , and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family is not@@ orious , and their reputation is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inflic@@ ted the family was stre@@ aking street fights with bas@@ eball bats , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ des and floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ done , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , had an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wood plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and had to call the police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing settled her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived 20 years beside them , and it was always bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countless times that we tell the police here , are incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we got up because it was so quiet here , we are not used to that ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house , where the police was rec@@ alled at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the over@@ grown site of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant was given to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ bly seen for their neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and provided us with the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti@@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers of property management will now have to we@@ ave garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ done was fine , after having found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ done , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police say they will deleg@@ ate tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners in order to protect our communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Portugal , tourists in Portugal are in panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet beach flies over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air forces said it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a deep jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed , like the military plane , almost in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the hu@@ stle and bustle , without seeing what came through the clouds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew two times very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists on the Av@@ eiro beach were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force arrived today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility , but the air forces continued to insist that safety at no time was at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; area fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly deep , because of the circumstances - strong fog and fire smoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona will take the first step on Sunday to win the first championship title in the new football season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must ren@@ ounce with the under@@ laid Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German suffered a change of b@@ anding in the knee in the training , which means that Bar@@ ca &apos;s objection had been clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years , the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique so far ren@@ ounced a clear decision on this subject and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but he was in the ranks of the most remaining applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know about S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday at the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sev@@ ille again took the 2 : 3 defeat for extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , aiming for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma Long in an own league , to table tennis gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ ranking first brought the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as expected , the two Chinese made it to the final game and made the title among themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and in time outs they had no coaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retired to the grand@@ stand , and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Z@@ hang had said sharply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma had to fight only in the first set , with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang there only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , however , there were enough breathtaking ballet changes to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov , 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an had hired a rib@@ bed injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were Olympia @-@ Fourth at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars &quot; huge problems &quot; in election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has weaknesses of his election campaign in the present republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns about correspon@@ dents reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after defe@@ ating 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp , there is no doubt that there is no doubt that the White House is successful in the fight for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for Republi@@ cans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as endangered , there are also Arizona and Georgia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC Senator , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to make money for the support of his campaign , he should not present better results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of it , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress are stronger than their arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia : three sc@@ am test on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the International Olympic Committee shared a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had announced that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , presented a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the K@@ eni@@ as team management by the D@@ oping Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Association of IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case , to ex@@ ert its own research , divided an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , put the test and signed it , &quot; declared K@@ eni@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became more than 800 meters in Beijing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments , athletes of his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing shipments , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , unusual events were pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the 2015 World Cup in Beijing , athletes won the most med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches have always been raised that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it could be proved that this type of sport has been comprehen@@ sively and systematically studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic romantic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , a surprising Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ate Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli , artistic director , wanted to bring musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orchestra is orchest@@ ral by the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Italian conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an elder Mary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminds herself with sorrow to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally unusual ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ili@@ a is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ cans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as descrip@@ tive as it was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ ye@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as warning and warning to others that are associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from East London boar@@ ded a plane to Turkey and then entered the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says that in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his nom@@ ination , the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have been blocked by Barack Obama in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he hadn &apos;t spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be Lak@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ per workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works together with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous naked men , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distinguishes itself , because &quot; Play@@ boy was for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classic naked , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release about the cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women will want to participate in this project , because it is a beautiful work of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models can submit their images online or , personally , to open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ ds of Germany reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; believe the Chairman of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , with tens of thousands of refugees in the medium term with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has re@@ ared Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds have fled Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees themselves in their own country has produced refugees , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeria cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stamp of fire as a Gü@@ len trailer destroys teachers and other acade@@ mics , who have a professional existence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as reported by the newspaper under the appeal of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks occupied the biggest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the reporting date June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , non @-@ war , poverty or lack of perspective are not found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the summer holidays in 2021 , the Parliament &apos;s Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because stupid as yet it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count them out at the end of the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign close to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting , how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D will cut off and what remains to be left at the end of co@@ ali@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels through the country , distributing roses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as it did his legendary wor@@ dless predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , sea ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame Merkel for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create the &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Home Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events ; Merkel &apos;s election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group was not right , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; lam@@ inated Vincent Kok@@ ert , secretary general of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U does not abst@@ ain from the usual poll@@ s at market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , he says , plays only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that on the country , you have to push the base to find a way to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are dealing with the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because much is in the game , Sell@@ ering has called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the S &amp; D Group was at least 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only slightly ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party , the small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the Parliament &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from holidays @-@ hard@@ ship , they make a modern virtue and move their election campaign largely on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ning fighters embar@@ k on search for native stimul@@ ants among the holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ye@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ ses with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 remedi@@ ation : restaurants suffering from barriers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is everywhere praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no distortion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commen@@ cement of those responsible for the construction work is commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation cruises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation within the site was relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the citizens can drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passage through the village seems to return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of Bach &apos;s road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sig@@ nage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the speed limits were not respected as well , the municipality increasingly demanded M@@ ös@@ singen &apos;s exhibition vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable over@@ ri@@ ots , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , two to three per minute have been bitten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 77 mph , the quick@@ est was on the way in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has resulted in revenue out@@ breaks , any one you ask can see through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; most modest decline &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship of Ma@@ ier , but also cle@@ ars the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running map is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most strongly , the locals are along the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales revenue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renovation of the street stopped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to divorce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt answered a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something generous has been handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t travel , it is also elsewhere beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that his pedi@@ gree comes back after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crises with a BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six months of construction work , which is brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terror , it is constantly being ro@@ wed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , what does a threat status to do with terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , I am involved in that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the interior minister , however , he was located on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presented a little bit of time before it presented its conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU rules on air passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD so far : he wants to face sympathy promotion for terrorist groups and press jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grants the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he considers it reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted at the country are supposed to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for security checks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of D@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put some even worse than previously - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to hide their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these are politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some things also work un@@ checked , leaving questions un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pol@@ lu@@ ents for example , the question arises : what really does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it can &apos;t be said , however , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things which people deeply engaged , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inner security has moved enormously to the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with internal security , the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , there was a high degree between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a thir@@ sty argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some union ministers , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ban and a rejection of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , too , is struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a turning away from the double pass , he does not hold anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make it new , it is not sensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his or her own parcel at all corners is un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things in it that might worry about quar@@ rels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the diesel engines , deliveries are rising worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , not in all markets it runs round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen stopped deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can further advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the core brand , VW , weak@@ en mainly in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened its total sales , as the company announced in Da@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide , the VW brand in July sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in Western Europe alone , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries of almost one sixth were bag@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weaker figures from July , above all , led to two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for exit from the EU also stressed a spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas has escal@@ ated first , a minus is also possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great support for Volkswagen is the Chinese market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony got off ably due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January to July , Group President Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated emission tests with a software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer guarantees a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Monday , VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport confirmed this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completely fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ qu@@ iry Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Transport , Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting and all type approval relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself does not use the term &quot; warranty , &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal has resulted in uncertainty about possible warranty claims as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , VW is not using the term &quot; Guarant@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands considerable savings in the future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Chief Financial Officer Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only 139 customers that can park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity should not be afraid to pay for its austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , it must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund demands this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been jumping 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs will now continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the banks of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the C@@ FO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most customers would have understand and changed to other investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide remuneration for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele which is luxuri@@ ously furnished by the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it boun@@ ces for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the co @-@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; currently has no other banks known to charge a compensation for private customers deposits , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition is tough , and the immigration of investors is threatening to compete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , customers in Germany will not be pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged loving plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you go to the comment section , to over@@ saw him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Al@@ le@@ One men &apos;s middle @-@ aged men with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the ren@@ aissance of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to a Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who recently bought a record , all for@@ esi@@ ght is between 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also not a horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog is a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , I hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the heart Soh@@ o slowly for@@ gets its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would probably ask the camera man to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : eight young women , three middle @-@ aged women , a woman , presumably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again selling objects he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media country , who have heard about the com@@ eback and have been prompted to buy their old records again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of fans of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes just a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ on@@ onica , to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves , of items that call for happy youth memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a simple way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not listened to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I am smo@@ other by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more product @-@ driven and less music @-@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older people who are coming slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ f@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ aned from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is more than a shopping window shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to explain it , it &apos;s really unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of sheet music lovers , Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I seem to wear the jeans , I watch a group of young teenagers group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cro@@ sley record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far from that it is impossible to touch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they are not considered un@@ accounted for at least in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in the reality , record transactions and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with the stro@@ lling through plat@@ ters of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er who sha@@ kes nothing on the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video face

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen , who examined the sh@@ arks , says that the record was with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 27@@ 2 and 5@@ 12 years old and five meters long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary stores , sell , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they assumed that the temporary stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary deals , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely track@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places threatened by the Dutch was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated by a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Dsch@@ el@@ ell@@ ager vivi@@ dly increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite Olympic disappointment , Martin remains fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ os Tony Martin does not want to be enter@@ tained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in view , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s difficult to comment yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had to analyse in peace , which causes would have led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sie@@ gem@@ und , who was pla@@ gu@@ ed by back problems , could only get its impact once and was power@@ less compared to the previous laps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , An@@ geli@@ que Ker@@ ber ( Kiel / No. 2 ) had the chance to jump into the qualification round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Australian Open winner , Johanna Kon@@ ta , met with the Australian Open Win@@ ner ( No. 10 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last German tennis player , Tommy Ha@@ as 2000 caught a medal in Sydney ( Silver ) in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group climbs up for live video games at start @-@ up
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watching other people playing video games is a huge success , and Microsoft will also benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up beam , which specializes in this hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a lot of money for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft did not share with it on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can watch others play , but also intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , they can give up orders and confront enemies and provide equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard game re@@ starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ ups , based in Seattle in the US state of Washington , move to Microsoft headquarters in the Califor@@ nian Red@@ mond , how Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the tak@@ eover has nothing to change for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the X@@ box console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market for live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are t@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ witch was purchased from the online retailer Amazon in 2014 , for almost a billion dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are intended to transfer tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ ders very effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futur@@ istically acting Enfor@@ cement of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , on highway constructions or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure a steady speed limit@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a permanent mobile construction can , however , be too dangerous or complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days at irregular intervals , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be collected across multiple lanes simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variable speed limits and driving b@@ ans by time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state @-@ run state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that it is not st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and , by the way , also disappear anti @-@ slip outer man@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold has taken
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 6 Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ odor@@ o Stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji spread a master class in handling , side stag@@ ings , cr@@ ut@@ ches , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was hated by the un@@ too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they lost only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji started marvel@@ ously , and fired the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au raised in the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ch@@ ub@@ by T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the seventh minute X@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua was a touch@@ down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the reg@@ atta , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learnt to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB performed basic changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea In@@ sul@@ ans , sw@@ inging flags and dancing on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB kno@@ cked down in the grass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match - Britain &apos;s transformation of difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the prize - and therefore the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the coach &apos;s cancer for rowing victory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no better gold than in those games , and that will mean something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 harsh pen@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , its 3@@ 9th un@@ insulated use , which is also unprecedented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sponge , which does not reflect the kind of triumph@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every gold in the herd there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make the difference , and no one knew how to survive this day if he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not , it is spreading everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio was lucky to start from the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the break to a minimum , in case that is the right term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ven@@ erable morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I have done , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training , or a better trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were caught very , very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really important to not let yourself be carried away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we weren &apos;t ready to make something great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for one year , before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all so new for me , and I was so stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a while ago , it was called the original sound in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia was damaged by the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Bavarian &quot; far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the association for 31 years , was 28 years as Managing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he was retired at the age of 65 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes annually about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congregations are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for other towns and villages , there are water supply contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the association in 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended the construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as outstanding events , she named the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and the renewal of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the modernization of water pipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added innovations , because water is the most important food for water and drinking water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her Lau@@ dati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his purpose , and he lived under the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the Wasser@@ forum des Lower Fran@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , he received a lot of praise and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , in turn , praised Water Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the best water@@ keeper , and he was a faithful boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were , however , the quar@@ ry at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a third January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained once , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the meanwhile eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has progres@@ sed well and now in private in New York where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something which dates back to two years when I sang in La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the most fortunate man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s relationship with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the escape , and after him I will be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a bald head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the man we@@ ars bald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who see Sven S. , will call the 110 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give information about the death or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we don &apos;t say at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to eye witnesses , a special detachment unit ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ wrapped and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial burdens , which are threatened by the industry from green electricity extraction , are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ung Edition ) said it remains in the liberation of Renew@@ able Energy in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG change of 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this , too , is not elevated in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our steel campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission rights trade , climate and employment goals are to be weighed , &quot; said IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the situation escal@@ ated further than the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel into the world market in view of the de@@ bilit@@ ating domestic demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers proposed price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , and the economic prospects in China have improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not want to exclude any closures of individual works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2015 , about 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the amount recovered now went back the second month in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a more lively , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense . H@@ ac@@ kler says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everyday life , he who requests his lungs is not so fast out of the box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für Sen@@ iors @-@ Organis@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs among older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia dis@@ ori@@ ent themselves to long @-@ lying events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when singing , the head also requires a special power , explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just elderly people , who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show yourself : if I practise for something long , I will improve and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the appropriate offer sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many cities offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the church or the church leader directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing does the soul well , and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats react more sensitive as han@@ go@@ ver to the cries of the young
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ stle of cat babies has on adult animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their surprise , the male also did not let the males cold - however , they still beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat babies on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they react ten percent faster to caus@@ tic burns , which are in great distress , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; han@@ go@@ vers also respond to the calls of kit@@ tens , but always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited youngsters are either not percep@@ tible or not important , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ tens was different with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female kit@@ tens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were played for a little bit by little ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited kit@@ tens , which were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the small sample for meaningful results , the researchers consider their results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted in a differentiated way to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they swi@@ vel faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited kit@@ tens turned off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologists in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , another important football match is held in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ ni@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , the official line is clearly the official line : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the suspension of the exceptional state after the uprising attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of regular citizens , should not be com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the motion of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it is not stopped even before football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the former St@@ ron@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; at public places across the country declared Erdo@@ gan finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport , like all the country , is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , fans of the minister &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what unites the Great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; gala , &quot; it will arrive especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as scor@@ scor@@ er of his club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finished the season in excellent fashion , and secured his team to the tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good @-@ bye in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g , it was only to sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protective @-@ King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also the reason , that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the occasion of the coup attempt at AC Florence , Gom@@ ez announced only after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to do so , however , the Stür@@ mer must be willing to abandon about a third of its estimated rate of 7.5 million euros , &quot; says Or@@ man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay its content in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als , at Olympic Games in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other super@@ led athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it , they fight in Rio for med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who compla@@ ined about her starting rights shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing ban , was mer@@ cil@@ essly o@@ vers@@ ed and de@@ bu@@ ed at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a strange scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall , and had provoked her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dar@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than ever before , he is the number one of the world over 100 m and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after her taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having suffered severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 and World Champion in 2013 and the European Championship was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine in 2010 and 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Per@@ kovic denied the intermediate intake , and was closed for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four fur@@ i@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , accompanied Mer@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has been the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an athlete has won so many med@@ als afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after it was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , he reg@@ ained the recognized Bron@@ cem@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world champion and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was first tested in May , but still allowed to start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champi@@ onships , references to taking a forbidden health supplement were found , the ban of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA dropped mild and expi@@ red on July 13 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bomb enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I was able to leave it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she planned her home journey for the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether of the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ al are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , as necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area around 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further man was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured by police instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the southeast coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not linked to the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is unclear what group is hiding behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police instructed her officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly do not judge tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the hom@@ ici@@ dal bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends inspec@@ ting the Thai security authorities on its homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) is applicable to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no longer trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military a great influence over the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not manage to get a grip on Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office of constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several regional offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors have also placed the group under surveillance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said the constitutional officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we observe the movement as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional guards in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the decision , Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; identical movement &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a juven@@ ile language often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Islam@@ ists , like right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own thing , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive factor , therefore , is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years , we have noticed that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; , or the Frei@@ taler Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that further right @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form , plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or European control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were established at the regional level , or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who hadn &apos;t appeared in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the susp@@ ects had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that had not been dealt with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always , the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ yed so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he simply disappeared , no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was rather his not just athletic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special charter law from the International Swimming Federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is distributed , in order to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since in Ethiopia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metre fre@@ est@@ yle , played no role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to take over 100 metres of outdoor style on his own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics , and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the New square has been co@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next morning came back at 8 : 15 o &apos;clock , the cas@@ hier was about 250 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , a video surveillance is not available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump does not look so narrow the im@@ pending electoral defeat
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then drive to the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential election in November , he wouldn &apos;t care : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist organisation Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post is entering retailers with electric transport
an electric motor vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the interest of other companies on the vehicle is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of next year , the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they will be delivered to their own Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , delivered with letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post office Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , about by craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group will shortly enter into mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in post @-@ factory manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year and a shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , adapt to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can imagine , that we can change the entire fleet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gf@@ K leadership reti@@ res after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management the global number five is facing a personnel new beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , the Gf@@ K Executive Board wants to leave the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ on is already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as early as September 1 , the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ vo@@ inger took the lead in the management board and shared the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; differing views &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not want to name a company spokes@@ woman on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , who will be leading the market research company is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in investor circles , it was on Friday , with the shareholders the disappointment on the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K summit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have to stop its dissip@@ ation in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter have above all imp@@ acted the value of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Experience business unit , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , made a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million under the balance sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ring@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an accident of a bus with 43 elderly passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the passengers suffered severe injuries , reported the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to turn to an opposite truck , partly on the opposite lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stopped right from the street and sli@@ d into a tren@@ ch , as a spokesperson of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade delivered the occup@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six ambul@@ ances , and an emergency ambul@@ ance , came to the accident site on the state road 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ injured passengers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns district of P@@ ew@@ sum , from a regular bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus for the travel company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators called for the truck , and possible witnesses to report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ thi@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of now 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( so far 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a sleep@@ y calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ haus@@ er ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , under@@ coverage was established for these sewage systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ saving manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ thi@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Al@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Administr@@ ative Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ coverage of the previous calculation period must also be compensated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt therefore argued that all three sewage systems are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the waste water flow in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses in all three plants , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were considerable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ thi@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that with the low waste water demand in the three plants , expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance were fully covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewage systems in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , as one could not extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach sewage utility to these facilities because it concerns defic@@ it@@ arian institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first to zero since October last year , posted positive 0.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( December 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prices remained unchanged at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat to 150 million daily users to change reality and play identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are un@@ paralleled , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the mistakes will come to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting the application of black face or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this week presented a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and pointed che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es were pointed to a bigger problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company offered an excuse : the filter was designed as an homage to anim@@ e characters , not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but outside persons experiencing racism , the filter reminded me of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others opted for the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and mil@@ dly said unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not secure , but that the yellow layer was drawn into the going lim@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counter@@ parts , could be more likely to expect sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder for such things to remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , invited others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related controversy mirrors a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has left the snapshot largely un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce , and indicates its status as private enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , it declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel responsible for concentrating on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military leadership for@@ fei@@ ted IS@@ IS intelligence service , states Committee of Congress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual state of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the U.S. armed forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported their assessments regarding the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence Information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly featured a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism , and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten @-@ page report shows detailed , detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into their lives , after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the general inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence committees published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged the moral under analy@@ st and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday , by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reported under investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who were recorded following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense had no reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key national defence issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alle@@ gations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminded of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , had fores@@ een a small occupation troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker pointed out that despite the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , comra@@ de Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general Austin went into retirement in April , and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the USA will win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain imminent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after winning three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not among the people , who keep their doors in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know , however , that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which will remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday , in the final round of the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place each within their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first placed the strong Dutch will slightly longer walk out of the way , which lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years playing a ho@@ ckey bat in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things upside down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work area in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can completely tear the ru@@ dder around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India had gone into the game without victory , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and pulled the ball into the goal to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rio de Janeiro events feel constantly and inevitable , a spe@@ edy relay race between competition and str@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the Tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queu@@ es , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens &apos; s@@ warm with dimples , could have been built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV commerci@@ als if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognised : aerial shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have the breast swimming , and may it reign long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I tend to make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed that many of those I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who managed it until the final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese , and Canadi@@ ans for the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but an expert enthusi@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and do@@ ves , the two sports that essentially uni@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asp@@ iring riders jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to reach a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and o@@ int@@ tos ) before they end up on their feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to official program , you will be assessed according to execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV transmission also another highlight : the world or the Olympic cord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal @-@ directed striving is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also what I feel , when looking at these games , as a bit ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline &apos;s vector is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final round will be staged on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round , as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the Olympics , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ look the general tum@@ ult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently hit the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia met by the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast @-@ growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months , protests against the government have shat@@ tered the country and expanded into more and more territories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on countless un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa , and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist hazards beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile , or sent to prison , or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have other options beyond protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a far @-@ critical vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line required hundreds of lives in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den who were more or less forced in recent years could use the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of de@@ bit@@ ing after years of de@@ bit@@ ing , under the surface now explo@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and improved internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered for protests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly to Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this , too , is changing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , in secret services , trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had been Ethiop@@ ian prime minister until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am desc@@ ends from the South . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia witnessed such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ ested against elections , which apparently were f@@ elled by the government and then stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and that period of un@@ rest was relatively quick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian Development Exper@@ ts engaged Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but evi@@ dently , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal affairs of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian town , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common@@ place in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ es flights over the neighboring Somalia , although she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states his statement Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissip@@ ate the last controversy on Friday surrounding his campaign , saying that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump retired on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to urge President and Mrs. Clinton to have created IS@@ IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought that accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement , rec@@ alling that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism sp@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on account of falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about Twitter , he warned that Clinton Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics , and then back on demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to the way the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more et@@ ched tone because its survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a lead with a major advantage in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , had great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements about whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ yards , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread aggres@@ sively in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and warned them of going on each of his words and pre@@ occupied with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only one more proof , that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café comes back in Green@@ point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a gay café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue stor@@ ef@@ ront were crowded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people lam@@ inated it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ell wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s new invention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ played Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long time member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it even uses the same lights , from the old verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are shri@@ mps like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural grain bowls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cafe serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club had closed , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new additive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before the work , and he always ordered the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Ros@@ enthal always receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a res@@ ent@@ ment , that the soap business took the old business room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee from the café as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will deal with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ pointed , also accepted the café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he prepared to turn them out , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened as the new cafe , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ecom@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a refined delic@@ acy for Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane brick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ lt@@ less snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper , which extends the ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ ws of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War , &quot; A Square Me@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique bl@@ ends have been tried , since a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication has priority over tastes or even wholes@@ ome cooking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , brick was prepared from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - contributed to the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; households &quot; and the challenge to turn P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like a million @-@ million man from the world to which he has become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room , and wore a smo@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to stat@@ u@@ ate an example with his stomach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , the residents of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors through Ms. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most desolate places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had better understood the habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone showed a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , Khal@@ ed O@@ mar , dedicated his life to the people of Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group who saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people according to the Bild newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian guard , showing him in an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , passed around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God is seeing a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicop@@ ters shed four drums across the Alz@@ hei@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an investigation on board the ship , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was born 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it is barely 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on saturated 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science , &quot; anyway from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this life span , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland would become stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the evidence was lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland ha@@ arks are hard to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was her slow @-@ pent@@ agon , as she was holding six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard with a transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another one swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher layers of water to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the greatest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the sh@@ arks of sh@@ arks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two little sh@@ arks had a noticeable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons hunt larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , in the third smallest animal of 220 centimet@@ res the l@@ enti@@ cular core contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , all major Greenland sh@@ arks used carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular core , producing cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the researchers could assign an age to the length . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with its increase obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , this should be world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , caught a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip on the neck , was caught before Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there also runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they mature later - and age slower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the heat loss of one gram of mouse is much larger than a gram of elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; says the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal , however , should invest its resources more in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent session , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the body made the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clearing the plot , clearing and closing questions and the moti@@ ons for surve@@ ying , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Street Road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer possible for interested parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality is convinced that the building areas in rural and quiet residential community , Schö@@ nau attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said , volunteers can immediately report to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of sub@@ time , the commercial area already proved there is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city on the Main is thus in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities to reloc@@ ate from London reloc@@ ated jobs and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very probable that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W competence field financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether the banks continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to be approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what large US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lobby association counts 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of fact , Luxemburg under@@ mines a large fund sector , but also cuts down as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the town stands out with slightly available commercial properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands at number seven , Luxemburg at number 19 , Dublin to number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; concludes the IC@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correlation of forces : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gilead maintains legal costs of hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , resulting from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ l and other im@@ moral actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the complaint on Thursday , US President Bethel Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead has claimed the cost incurred during the defence of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed mutual ownership and property on laboratory work , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the US , troops supported that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. supported troops rec@@ ap@@ tured the total control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a spokesman for the group on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the departure of the still remaining group of fighters who have dug up within the city , the city of Syria is currently comb@@ ating the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they released more than 2,000 civilians , held by fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earnings 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Pres@@ idential candidate and her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his promises to date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , even though they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check through the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax reviews were not completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to pose questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , particularly with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , in which High @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invite his tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no taxes for two years during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also undergone an I@@ RS tax check , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign has released its tax return , until 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clinton &apos;s , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average federal tax rate of ca . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the declaration of tax of the Clinton Clinton in 2015 showed that only USD 100 of its income was obtained , unlike the majority of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their main investment was a cost effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues contributed USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ illi powder ; fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ illi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fies its support by exercising volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friday is the day of wel@@ ders dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities without harm the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include lighting the eleph@@ ants with a torch , and blowing in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is kind@@ led , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ illi in the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , a touch is usually sufficient to chase the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last possibility is a gol@@ fer , who shoots a gold fireworks fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal coun@@ cill@@ or unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk reconstruction at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects take part in the businesses with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail trade in the core city is still considered considerably exp@@ and@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the motion for the new building of a commercial ski factory on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction declined unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we generally welcome new business@@ men , but at this location on the Rhine shore this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pres@@ election as it could have claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anno@@ y@@ ance at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s country code list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be sum@@ mon@@ ed directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel eliminated and deleted ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an explanation , the director looked at the hotel reception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he got there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason behind it , triggered even more anger in the director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were shocked by this event , and were dis@@ ma@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ and@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them sign@@ posted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given up the supposed re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , indicating that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alle@@ gations of herself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be included in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered together to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students apart , which led the police to engage in rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred students participated in the demonstrations , in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the protest@@ ors were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er on walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lifting of the sanctions grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade offset between Moscow and Teher@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been aboli@@ shed , the interest in Russian companies in the country has grown rapidly , the ambassador announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to witness : inf@@ estation of beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ bery was perpet@@ rated on Thursday evening on the Be@@ we XXL Be@@ verage Market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the am@@ bush of a gun , three dark dressed people , who had war@@ med their faces , came out of the staff of the drink market and then fled by foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money was captured , the police do not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beverage market is directly accessible from the market deck of the Re@@ we market , and is poorly accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the raid , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel car park located opposite the parking house , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have observed at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should report urgently to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and having fun during the summer season
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social education group / social group work of the child protection group Nag@@ old , with their assistants on their summer free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quiet hamlet of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first week of school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ TB with the visit of the z@@ oos zoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days , the group at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culinary were given to children and car@@ ers with their own meals like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in workshops , beautiful jewelry is made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of hom@@ ecom@@ ing , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the eye care unit Ey@@ eli@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day hike from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , four stages were tac@@ kled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next roman@@ cer of all mini @-@ stran@@ ts in probably two years , the minister &apos;s round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and perform several days of pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year was a special pilgrimage destination for the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the Holy One , went their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Our Lady stood and so the pilgrimage was started by the Mu@@ enster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made an attempt to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgri@@ m songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the overnight stays , the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty , star@@ chy dinner and breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , we went to Gü@@ ts@@ bach on the second day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to be lowered by about 500 metres and then climbed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive minster of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the final stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly relieved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg Cathedral later in the afternoon , passing through the gates of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is welcome by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , there was still time for the gau@@ cho metropolis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , we went back to Hor@@ b by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storm home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the men team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead , which his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London railway world champi@@ onships in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did this in time , as an indication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prevailed in the first lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap there was a short distance , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driven in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they stepped onto the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It is a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just here to do my best , and make myself a name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic Board and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the page of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he with@@ drew this statement later , and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three months , we have come together as a team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been so badly hit with so many world titles , that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the velo@@ drome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same as Ho@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre four @-@ kilometre race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had disputed before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura leaves Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK team is relying on his strong track team , to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a pair of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ bling vor@@ ti@@ ces as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
future of the melt mill of Port@@ land on the basis of lifting the energy demand
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the system operator termin@@ ates the supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a grant , established for 20 years , exp@@ ires in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ co@@ a plant in Port@@ land are on the go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect , could be at risk in closing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt mill uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Point Henry melt mill , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enam@@ el of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land loses money , and risks a closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p maintain small proportions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt mill , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts should be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force starting in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts was already depreci@@ ated in its annual depreciation amounting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; A@@ bility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that 2010 concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force in November , even if there is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago generate about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it would not be good for us as a generating set , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls somehow at this publicity city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , safety began with a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue cover was concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Vo@@ gue , the September edition is the most sold edition of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure of his cover stars is expected so much , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s cover women who were already on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; model &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer La@@ wrence was on the cover in 2013 after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are really talented women , who sign out in the entertainment industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the world of fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these feelings stir up again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , it seems to pass by the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself , on their pay@@ wall apps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her spare time she is shown in Reality TV , probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; annually there are 160@@ ,000 people annually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the countries &quot; need for assistance are rejected annually by the council centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair delay and the like - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality &apos;s legal services , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cultural Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been rejected each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government , the situation would only become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems right and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June 2017 , the German government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Adju@@ st@@ ment Officer and sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the regional government met its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of staff allegedly drew weapon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action , when she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina sent a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident was described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , pulled off a gun and put his right hand index finger on the trigger and took his course to Vinc@@ enza Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired for damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment people were to take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from context , and that he would not go@@ vern violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is Compla@@ int requests damages from the campaign for violation of due diligence and Philip for bodily harm and permanent mental damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump Press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President , Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before EU elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are notable for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys by the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD jumped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite moderate losses , the Green Party was back in Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite moderate losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the Berlin SPD poll@@ ed only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U only achieved 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they still lag behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , but the pirates would miss it in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would last for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet portal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even via fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ Browser , even though agon@@ izing slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , which means about 1400 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one could guess in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , vendors are domin@@ ating the market , all of them later than Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless App vendors and telecommunications companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march , still today , is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors , such as Samsung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone out , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff at the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , permanent availability is considered a curse and a blessing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must steer the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , as well as in 2012 in London , when we were doing a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and provide an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the Games , and that we will am@@ end ourselves on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 , and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not a single infrastructure project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn to natural growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to provide a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK , and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus - Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software vendors tries to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cra@@ b and mouse game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding concerning his ads to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of the part of the advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the nar@@ r@@ ator of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into battle , is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display block@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company refra@@ ined from doing ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook is a worthwhile investment for such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would actu@@ alize its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to have more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , therefore we are planning to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman on Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have concentrated on developer tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the night , the victim was on the highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday , the police are calling for a supposed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police declared in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49 , who was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , asking these and every witness of the incident to report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , two similar cases show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after surviving a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and was unconscious in the street , took the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists at the God@@ dar@@ d Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ ared with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still turned slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ ents its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than most of the Earth today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their oceans evapor@@ ated , and their water vap@@ our was burned off by ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the same as we know it today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and introduced a small co @-@ determination right for the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an alternative president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic , this decision confirmed and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , these conditions are not met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he did for our organization , and we wish him only the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season in the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 season , Roy received the winner of the league title as the best coach of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference at five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers resume talks , putting on strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes relating to the remuneration for North Sea workers will be suspended , as all dispute parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , said negotiations negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop several day @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start early next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the Wood Group has cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s rating agency follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors , in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities with the British energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates , among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades stars building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ er understand why stars are rotating in cluster amounts to different rates , and in which context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the birth of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this star @-@ run , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are turning now fastest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to peak rotation rates , these ri@@ pping stars po@@ ise large amounts of star winds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates , that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while bigger stars slowly rotate pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , the younger and the older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in prime time from base to base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 at the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game atten@@ de@@ es of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his signature below a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach in the future - in full salary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mile@@ stones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should still not be recorded in the Hall Hall of the Ba@@ eb@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field , is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the super@@ star to have banned co@@ ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered a major suspect , for years having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his farewell days , too , were not silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends played the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and stated to the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Or@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi and Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an er@@ ased athlete would have won almost a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become famous for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle runner from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news arrives at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Sunday , Ch@@ en has demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de which is used as a mask for dop@@ ing substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , CA@@ S International Sports Court confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m of free style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , he applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the night of Rio the news filtered through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it is alleged that the forbidden substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should have already had a positive effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov so@@ aked in reply immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t have the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing loaded nation must not take part in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ aboli@@ shed ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both of them deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Federation of IA@@ AF banned the entire Russian squ@@ ad , except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pool sport , earlier shipments in China were also cat@@ ered for violent confron@@ tations among athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ bles li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of free style , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping stock@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three month lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : h@@ ack@@ ers comp@@ ress their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , programmers from black@@ mail malware attack targeted companies - and they are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have at least once been victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetrators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are increasingly special@@ ising in attacks in company networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potentially fierce ran@@ som money is much higher than in private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently observing a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware , and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get the final code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the damage is higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of stagn@@ ation in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators &quot; demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ack@@ ers , on the other hand , know this and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , create freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the potentially high and relatively high risk profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ sts then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , one logs in one of the forums on the background , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typically , criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 50 percent of the IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on their ability to ward off Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not an adequate threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the offen@@ ders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the C@@ acker Conference of Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V acts rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling slightly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is available for storage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests , but there is the magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seating areas of the back bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ chairs and offer storage space , which is height up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide re@@ v ranges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he should do his job a bit more quiet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another engine , a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steering is , however , a bit more direct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the Lane Assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because in manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition , and throt@@ tles the speed when needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest , making it a bit aw@@ k@@ ward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airline not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liability is only possible in case of risks which are typical of aviation , the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the fall , the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
cases of disease : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their trip , sick tourists only get money back if the cause of the illness is doub@@ t@@ ful in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the case , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ ish exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness returned to a defective treatment plant , which supposedly polluted the sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had the view that the trip had been insufficient , and compla@@ ined about the organizers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the organizers only experienced it before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hurt his duties , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially , no contamination was found in the samples of the water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disease of several hotel guests , possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion , belongs to the general risk of living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ utely react to terrorist hazards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if convic@@ ted criminals had to leave the country faster , the security and strength of the population for refugee policy also increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement proposals until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce will be am@@ ended , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last much @-@ discussed welding obligation for physicians is to be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions such as the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sho@@ emaker in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel spoke to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union for a ban on discrimination and the abolition of double citizenship before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can talk about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party leader Sim@@ one Peter threw the minister to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorism act and ability to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring the people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway bridge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ umps regularly on the street , here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is good news for all truck drivers , who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße , the right @-@ road track by 700 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers can then directly thread the hammer , right from the hammer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main advantage is that traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the whole procedure is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the municipality of Mu@@ enster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mot@@ orists on the train station nerv@@ ously anno@@ y drivers , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her trail and sometimes also beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason is the needle hole on the B 51 , shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second track had to be rebuilt in a good , three @-@ quarters years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : stati@@ cal calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to record heavy duty traffic in two lanes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected work@@ day traffic will continue , the competent state can &apos;t say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official residual use of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal permit , the state operation deliberately chose the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because with disabilities it may be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday , on the construction site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intercultural Travel : cultural opportunities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with immigration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the youngsters in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ima Club , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers for children and families in theatre play , theatrical language transfer are planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south @-@ west of Germany , the weather has made a strike in the south @-@ west of Germany by the bill on Friday - but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the shooting stars , Per@@ sei@@ ds are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their name , because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing night : advice to sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you sit awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is all , but relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleeping problems manifest ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be under@@ pinn@@ ed by Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of directors of the German Society of Sle@@ eping Beauty and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Domestic Medical Association , says that he is a member of the Lower Saxony Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also put medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it can be , that different factors are bed@@ bugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disk failure can be bad , wake every two to three hours and possibly starts thinking about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s one example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when should I go with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advises We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , low @-@ lowered sleep medicine hardly exists , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be clari@@ fied with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of path@@ ological sleep@@ iness , sleeping @-@ trans@@ duc@@ ers or if the cause of a sleeping disorder is not found , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a fe@@ ather on the finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite a lot of screws , where you can sleep for better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it counts on : regular sleep and raising times , don &apos;t sleep too long , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and not at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s totally not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself to the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is , via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the short @-@ circuit world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the former DS@@ V Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has protected his former team@@ mates via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , whereas the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate so precisely on dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is exactly how it should be held with countries , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time prior to WM / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , two women and two men from 50 to 61 years of age were arrested on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suspect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els as ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 9.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials at the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang known to polic@@ emen of past anti @-@ theft crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and worked in a collaborative and highly professional manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ative Council 34 can demonstrate four acts , especially for crimes committed to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , they had captured more than 15,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in appears at first glance , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumped onto the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demoli@@ shed , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , is , however , favor@@ ed with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are rooms occupied and used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator handle had spoken for a hard working of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a point of departure of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 22 June , on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ smi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , pat@@ ro@@ fied official statements with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked visitors away from entering the house with number 94 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are especially generic from the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound according to a Kiev neighborhood , which had a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Mainz street close to the Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer had been granted a regular street battle in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ uting liner from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at dump@@ ed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body violation , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the crimes perpet@@ u@@ ate damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the famous burning cars , too , have no longer existed directly in the ri@@ gs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it was so important to her that residents get their way back : from police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the significance of the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road is still taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ drunk , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should one do , if someone never listen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs , the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you pull out , you should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area to complain about noise there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons , only presented with names , have asked not to be named with their correct name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ces is the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social worker supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers of honour are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here : the s@@ ini@@ ster wo@@ olen cloth that has a problem above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , some - less ridi@@ culous than the multitude of desired tasks - had meant purpos@@ efully - meaning that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , an inci@@ dental wo@@ olen cloth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ces writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ces supports hon@@ our@@ able and full time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soon , new containers are in the washing line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time now , it has been a serious problem to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the connection provision , the municipalities are responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the responsibility changes from the district office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , the search has been very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work so that one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , communal apartments must be made as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , soon new containers will be installed in the washing line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only with dwell@@ ings it is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be bra@@ zen or set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people work in the building yard or help home masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she hopes that the work for community leads to a positive external action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , activity does not only mean labor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ ces and customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so here , administration and volunteers also jump here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain the refugees that it is just taking time and brid@@ ging the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , problem cases exist , customers are honest , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ ces and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is already an &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : do the two after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customers are quite clear , &quot; what some nai@@ vely may call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these events are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the attack@@ ers were completely retri@@ eving them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the local and local government must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , politics atro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the authors are already busy , too , to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters wanted
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about an hour , the police helicopter flew off several areas - un@@ successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants surprised the two , and struck the bar@@ b@@ arians in the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ Power jeans and black hoo@@ ded bu@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the police set up several stri@@ ves and a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ahn@@ ging went without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the unknow@@ ns , in fact , fell close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police identified after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attack on a Ul@@ m I@@ mb@@ iss , the police were investigating six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker environment because of severe land peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for housing searches , evidence and in@@ toxic@@ ation were guaranteed , the police reported on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police in July , some 20 mas@@ ked men of a ro@@ cker @-@ like group@@ ing had thrown bottles and stones against the window window of an I@@ mb@@ is@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they should attack two guests and have a slightly injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they fled . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the I@@ mb@@ iss and adjacent building , there was a loss of 10@@ 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , there is a dispute in the Ul@@ mer ro@@ cker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thurin@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec joined the turnover billion closer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Asia , a high demand for medical technology in Asia stimulated sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first nine months of the financial year , group sales increased by 6.@@ 7 percent to EUR 7@@ 9@@ 8.@@ 6 million , such as the listed company on Friday in Jena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Asia business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the interim balance of € 8@@ 9.@@ 5 million , earnings before interest and taxes rose to € 1@@ 10.@@ 5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this financial year , the Jena Medical Device Group wants to exceed the sales mark of one billion euros , re@@ affir@@ med the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec manufactures equipment and equipment for medical practices and clinics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which belongs to the optics and electronics company Carl Zei@@ ss ( Ober@@ kochen ) , employs about 3,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
