28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and the investigation was running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters &apos;s restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed at the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are during this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone , who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combining his way with his family was to always make us cook for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the brother , who swa@@ m with the river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day bri@@ ghtly , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has information about this case is asked to call the C@@ SF@@ PD , under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston hasn &apos;t always been perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview , Hollywood star has now clearly stated that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or glued on from the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more simple to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of tel@@ ev@@ isions with relaxed de@@ bris and Mexican food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film runs with us starting on August 25 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sporting pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted at home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with that , the riding career ended again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he could not even go for photo purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a small gala , German sporting aid delivered the Golden Sport pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lor@@ rel leaf , Champion @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th awar@@ dee of the sport pyramid is long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Aachen on Saturday , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t - the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be - the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be - the singer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be - the jumping riders Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball of Er@@ hard Wonder@@ s .
many of these sports le@@ agues had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company im@@ migr@@ ated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Price was running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance from the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential competitors are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one , about the role of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive down regulations massi@@ vely , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this regard , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , party @-@ internal discussions could be provided on Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants , and re @-@ ride coal mining in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and it intends to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , plans to extend the renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better , too , for Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says , he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather on the taxation of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a large kitchen , four women sit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each has a baby , which is only one year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has put her little son in her arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with big eyes , he looked inqu@@ isi@@ tive into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance services in Bavaria , and focuses on women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are chi@@ ckens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they live in the north of Munich , one of the few de@@ centralized units for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has opened up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 people live there , about 40 women and 20 children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no men , neither as visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman arriving here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ als secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they acc@@ use Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that around 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreciate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , many women are used to say nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what I have experienced because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , some respond with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not separated , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ woman of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ ches there are in some common shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EP Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be placed separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published by the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women should be accommodated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or will men and women stay together , it can become - continuing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need for protection , one can read on the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new work competition measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new work @-@ fighting measures , with regard to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that the ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in favour of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; to problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations on all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC committee today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting in early September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistants , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be compulsory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : &quot; an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes on his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded Hall of Saint Petersburg palace , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pping , and he radi@@ ated almost no heat , even for his restrained relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend , &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ se becomes difficult , if not impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , state @-@ controlled media launched a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been bitten by a failed coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a failed coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti outlined it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , considering the response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will lead to the continuing gru@@ dge over the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus with certainty that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that reject and badly treat themselves from the West , and now join them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member f@@ lowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bank &apos;s chief executive , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , it has decided to put more national brands into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock quotes are changed to Nat@@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other smaller brands for the private client business that will be more significant - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand , as well as the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop ourselves as a bank of brands , because how do we focus on it ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would have been a great bench for our customers and launched these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think that you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3@@ 000@@ th gain in New@@ market on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , bringing 3,000 profit to him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he bets on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Douglas Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ times winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am relieved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he re@@ covers his victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career star@@ lings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m , and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which few have reached before him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already thrilled fans for this type of sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already picked 6.000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but he is also an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of British flat race for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot 1996 , but he also survived a crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5,000 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin sm@@ ashes Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence of Putin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin is saying that without giving reasons for the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ovo of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was his deputy in 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Krem@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became a log manager and chief executive of the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin informed Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do the smiling faces convince you ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has made Moscow mysterious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ cies Vladimir Putin , working as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , once again wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you might almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service in K@@ GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month at a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement its termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son , who was playing the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was announced on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the set , it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart blood , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans for a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned radiation of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September , 28th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puzzle for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ban@@ ff resident requested help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain of fountains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is planned to be completed by May 2017 , which is a £ 1.@@ 35 bn project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be completed by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project is planned to be completed by May 2017 , which is a £ 1.@@ 35 billion project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , almost 79 % of the deck decks are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete cast today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this fantastic project , the closure represents trend @-@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or the country side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge , 700 milli@@ metres south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a massive , and at the same time very delicate activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delicate , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were lucky enough to be alive , after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat was moving from their own strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its vicinity turned around and presented us the worst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the head of the rescue station by Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop , but it was released by the person who controlled the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , someone has w@@ aking up about these men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; badly injured - man sti@@ fled to his ex @-@ girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came to the tabernacle , he stab@@ bed it twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand , and in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , she al@@ armed his sister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she could not move to leave the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her companions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street , she met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old divor@@ ced his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should become much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one react to bad news , that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments over the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session , the SPD proposes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big dispute in the town hall , however , is that Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing financing programme , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed , is intended to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as little as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite this , viol@@ ently , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet the program is not yet complete : because the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how can one compensate for the loss of further 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding is going to run over the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , as planned by Nicole Palm , planning policy spokesperson should now be purchased from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West@@ stadt , the end of the year is sl@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased , the aim of so @-@ called mixing is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect it to be still moving in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although , they have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does not mean , however , that a compromise cannot yet be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that te@@ ens and kid do not go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time using screens , was compla@@ ined of many in the last decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game , when it was younger , joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursued its 35@@ ,000 users , reported recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , it only sees the raw data to increase performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health , people want to take &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; get out of the sofa , &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the significance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do sports regularly , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity aids in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people even close , even new friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also mos@@ quit@@ oes , who always have to complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Smartphone Apps such as Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its charm , and the use will be recre@@ ated with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now finally , Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast en@@ cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world , before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her total score of 6@@ 2.7 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will be held on the Swe@@ at Bar during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and is the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she broke into tears when her end result was shown , and her long journey took an end to her long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of their sport , including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not returned with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during its long journey , it &apos;s not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ ble pass - is tuned to Latin American music which would suit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school trip to the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ a was able to lead through two turns , the picture was clou@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swe@@ be@@ beam and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ie - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once again picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and put one on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her sof@@ tly when they expected her permission - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; grand@@ ma , &quot; has a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their land exercise , she threw out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police : 3 victims in serial killer case , shot in car listening in the car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela G@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots out of a hand fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is able to read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 belonging to one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the polic@@ eman of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks within four months in nine attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence , which led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a witness informed the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car , and listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also released a police report about the sho@@ ot@@ ings that crashed on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sco@@ op out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like least of his age , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , I did not let myself down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t talk .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle ride .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please come out with something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the a@@ ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , how it will affect the life of infected with the ci@@ a@@ virus infected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she still doesn &apos;t know , still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the a@@ ic@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , that it will be better for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for emergency , on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; State officials have been in constant contact with local authorities and have already been on the road to help the communities concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said that the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , alone , would have requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , to Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather service decre@@ ed that , in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River A@@ mite near Den@@ ham Springs , located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could wash many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ p@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue teams still hoo@@ ked up people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by the bell on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , hei@@ gh@@ tened overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife said to Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , when she lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the only one who could swim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that Emer@@ gency Aid had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ bers , where they stayed until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities could take ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr K@@ rau@@ tmann said that since Wednesday , the ground has been completely absorbed by the rainf@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floo@@ ding resulted in the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish , and a loss of lessons in five school districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ F , reported that there were 200 surviving houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were now flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were washed from floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the towns of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return back into their homes , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed because of the high water and sand bags were provided for the residents to participate , hoping to keep the water from their homes and stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining along the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but no reports have been reported on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; Sur@@ gery survi@@ ves in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several violations , including the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pun@@ ched out of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with , presumably , to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown was one of four , who were shot at German@@ town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reports the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that , apparently , there was a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cartridge sleeves for storm ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were approaching the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were seals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; reported police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police re@@ port@@ edly insp@@ ected the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane residential area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ covers , and the police are still looking for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns , and that for more than one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , I &apos;ve been with any summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and secondly : this team has three female gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man who is the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this team reflects the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last four years , the number one among female female women was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that shows strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and the USA che@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championship in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but this is not the case for trainers in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie followed the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gym@@ na@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gym@@ nasi@@ ums that are maintained by parents , which arise for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for trainers and their families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these trainers are in prosp@@ erous suburbs , which can support the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner gets their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to be inspired by countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy accessible gym . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics for young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers life @-@ long health benefits , as well as for academic and professional success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which makes thousands of young girls interested in the tower and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic Team square and thank you to start your way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for election rejected him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend schedules in order to improve the care of scheduled times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A comb@@ i tee for assistance doctors said last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors made serious concerns about the proposed agreement , particularly that it will heat up the current financial crisis and pay it to all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes met with the government for opposition and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened because of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the penetration and appeal to the doctors &quot; concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do so , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out other work conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in giving doctors on the strike chain cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes , by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A proposes a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians , who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS , urged the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures achieve nothing of the little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the assistant of the assistance doctors and answered positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries concerning tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health in terms of adher@@ ence to agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce heart risk risk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority ( N@@ ICE ) recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority ( N@@ ICE ) recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots which c@@ logged blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons who had already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture decl@@ ines electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , like a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ uses the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; abuse of eth@@ ni@@ es and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to use shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a card , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they leave their vote to prevent someone twice chooses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to protect electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial culture that comes with it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als , East of London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man should be relieved after a lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses somebody else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , in particular , alar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of outs to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Alban@@ ian background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... governmental institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric addressed 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit brief@@ ings to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider options to ask voters for your identification , before choosing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone twice chooses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists process full let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes of letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the power to set off shut @-@ offs to set up poll@@ ing stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of law , facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photograph@@ ing ban in vot@@ er stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requirement , that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters are alone in the election cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case , no criminal charges were placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for corrupt and illegal practices as inadequate , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ti@@ cking checks &quot; of the city hall &apos;s election registration departments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court verdict in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger , and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be over the French bicycle athlete Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which has turned out to be an impressive double keeper of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only athlete to win gold , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces running on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hunter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Kate &apos;s twin sister on the bicycle race track , many people in the internet pointed out how a certain Bow@@ man could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star unusually similar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as a double commu@@ ter for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is an athletic version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athletic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption act@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while American Adrian Adrian was att@@ ested to an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others like the simil@@ arities , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nes Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his asser@@ tion that Chinese swi@@ mmer , like a pig , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; like M@@ ief , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ stil@@ ts@@ hip surrender his own opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , was able to say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , as he had called , he died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ is , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
viewers all over Canada re@@ acted fast online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane T@@ we@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get it , that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ is from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection baby . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , many of which made him talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard , how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow ! # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you represent the C@@ BC and Canada , and lets us look like c@@ assi@@ sts . # cli@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comments about a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we &apos;re sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ ald via Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other t@@ witter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed , and issued a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ respect was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sam@@ pled under sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try pants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear she left her and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own str@@ um pants and pants and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , drew up and went out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b someone to observe , or think about the person who , under certain circumstances , buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how strange to think someone would take home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched her and went out and she did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wers around for your smo@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re approaching from behind , you should turn around first so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free ell@@ bow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then beat him with his knee into the body and twist , while the att@@ acker cro@@ ops off pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while attacking the weapon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and put the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that at a rob@@ bery is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - if you are not a Grand@@ master , Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the most dirty places in Europe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British trav@@ eller under@@ nour@@ ished his immune system and pro@@ g@@ nosis of a serious test , breaking some of Europe &apos;s most dirty and disgu@@ sting places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the moder@@ ator and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k completed his course on a Euro ticket , a hand@@ rail on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before dropping any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to tell us what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , nothing left nothing to li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his Dar@@ ms by travelling through the world , eating peculiar and wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public funds to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task definitely put down its immune system under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his trial score displayed a lumin@@ ometric figure of more than 4,000 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to dock after its lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are one of less than 60 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the worst thing I have cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more embarrass@@ ing than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will lick here anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ ori@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had said some of the things I had to tell him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to take Ian to lick her and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ ge with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ done and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints about her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their homes , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls had g@@ aping holes , wood plan@@ ks were torn down , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family were res@@ ett@@ led , and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on fighting people , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ pping and cur@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ done , 47 , whose name stood on the lease was in June an order for anti@@ social behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wood plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street , and had to call the police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ u@@ ged her and her partner this week by viol@@ ently from the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived next to them for 20 years , and it was always bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house , where the police was rec@@ alled at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the over@@ grown site of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horri@@ bly seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who are brave and have given us the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ zing on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers in the house administration will now have to we@@ ave garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash equivalent to £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ done was fine , after having found guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial for@@ esi@@ ght . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ done , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having been homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police say they will deleg@@ ate r@@ enter , who do not stick to the house rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without any self @-@ accus@@ ation as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Portugal , tourists are in panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet is flying over the beach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force , an unbelievable storm flight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air forces said it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a ne@@ ph@@ one@@ al jet crashed across a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic video recordings showed , as the military plane was flying almost in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the hu@@ stle and bustle , without first seeing what came through the clouds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew two times very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach , tourists were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force arrived today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility around the area , but the air forces kept insi@@ sting that safety at no time was at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; area fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force reported that the pilot had to fly as low as possible because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sev@@ ille - The FC Barcelona , on Sunday , is the first step to win the first prize in the new football season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup west@@ ward against the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the double winner must abst@@ ain from the under@@ laid Cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europa League champion among others , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German suffered a change in knees in the training , which at least initially resolved with Bar@@ ca &apos;s favour in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years , the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique had so far ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but he took the lead in most other applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness of the team that was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. had not really convinced the 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sev@@ ille again took the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , aiming for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma Long in an own league , to table tennis gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5 4,@@ 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it the world @-@ ranking first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as expected , the two Chinese made it into the final game and made the title among themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia Tower was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between sentences and in time outs they had no coaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had withdrawn from the tri@@ bun@@ e , and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mattress up to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma had to fight only in the first set , with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , sufficient breathtaking ballet changes were to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow , 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an had a ri@@ pple injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis age Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ million@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after leaving 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts start to grow in the battle for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have serious problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ old w@@ ob@@ bling
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for Republi@@ cans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equ@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as endangered , there are also Arizona and Georgia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to aboli@@ sh money to support its campaign , it should not present better poll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress are stronger than their arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia : three sc@@ am test on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a discipline commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened by the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fraud test in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a discipline commission to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had announced that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the K@@ eni@@ as team management by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Association of IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case , to ex@@ ert its own research , divided an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , put the test and signed it , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was owned by the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ Vi@@ erter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests , against cash payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ enses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , unusual events were pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight conform to the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the 2015 World Cup in Beijing , athletes won the most med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches have always been raised that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian light athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it could be proved that this type of sport has been op@@ ended and systematically ton@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , a surprising Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ate Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artistic director , Cec@@ ili@@ a Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an elder Mary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminds herself with sorrow to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally unusual ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song , &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ili@@ a is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Philip W@@ m , American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as it was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reports according to reports in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had left to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as warning and warning to others that are associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the East of London boar@@ ded an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says that in the case of a winning victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its nom@@ ination , the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have been blocked by Barack Obama in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Gar@@ land to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later , that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Republi@@ cans blocked the nom@@ ination , Lak@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ per workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works together with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous naked men , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distinguishes itself , because &quot; Play@@ boy was for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes it is the calendar also does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to release the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women will want to participate in this project , because it is a beautiful work of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models can submit their images online or , personally , to open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ ds of Germany reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; might be killed , the Chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees in the medium term with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has re@@ treated Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds have fled Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees themselves in their own country has produced refugees , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Union accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan now wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its adher@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the br@@ anding of the Gü@@ len trailer , both teachers and other acade@@ mics , destroys the professional existence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ ws , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the newspaper reports on the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks occupied the biggest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the reporting date June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , non @-@ war , poverty or lack of perspective are not found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign , and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because stupid as yet it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so don &apos;t choose the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the Feri@@ a , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting , how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D will cut off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels across the country , spreads roses and sw@@ aps a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ dless predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ee has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the debt to blo@@ om the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; We create that &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes an election campaign at the wrong time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group was not right , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; lam@@ inated Vincent Kok@@ ert , secretary general of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U does not abst@@ ain from the usual poll@@ s at market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , plays only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the Union has noticed that on the country you will find the basis that it has to be very strict to find a link to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the S &amp; D Group was at least 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party , the small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the Parliament &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from holidays @-@ hard@@ ship , they make a modern virtue and embarrass@@ ed their campaign largely on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on track search for native stimul@@ ants among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ ses with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants are suffering from block@@ age
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is everywhere praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty crazy , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff talks about the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is also no distortion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commen@@ cement of those responsible for the construction work is commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation cruises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation within the site was relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the citizens can drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passage through the village seems to be gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the vice @-@ manager Florian King responsible for the traffic @-@ related management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sig@@ nage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the speed limits were not observed as well , the municipality continued to challenge the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable en@@ rol@@ ments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , two to three per minute have been bitten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 77 mph , the fastest was on the way in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 @-@ R has led to revenue out@@ breaks with them , everyone you ask can look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some are more and some are less affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is produced for other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship of Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most modest decline , &quot; but also grants that &quot; course of course is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most strongly , the locals are along the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales revenue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the street refur@@ bish@@ ment continued its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have been dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt answered a question of G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such a lot has been handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t travel , it is also elsewhere beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that his pedi@@ gree comes back after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six months of construction work , which is brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terror , laws are constantly being ro@@ uted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère sets out a huge security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , what does an insul@@ t status have to do with terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also took part in that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the interior minister , however , he was located on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presented a little time before it presented its conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority in order to secure encrypted communications is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives on air passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to face sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grants the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he considers it reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees that are targeted specifically in the country should let their smartphones be checked and use social media accounts for safety verification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of D@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put some even worse than previously - about those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these are politically and legally , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things are still un@@ explained , and are open to questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pol@@ lu@@ ents for example , the question arises : what really does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not possible to deny that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people were worried about security because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things which people deeply engaged , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inner security has been enormous in the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , there are campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , the two parties went high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , a third argument about the equipment of the German police , then a security policy collection of some union ministers , in which the resort chiefs demand a bur@@ ban and a ren@@ unciation of dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , too , is struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a turning away from the double pass , he thinks nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make it new , don &apos;t make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his or her own parcel at all corners is un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things that might cause controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet Volkswagen got off lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the diesel engines , deliveries are rising worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , not in all markets it runs smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen launches in the second half @-@ year when the deliveries are made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the core brand , VW , was weak@@ ening primarily in Western Europe and thus imp@@ acted the total sales , as stated in the Da@@ x notified company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the VW brand , with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the home market , Germany bag@@ ged deliveries by almost a sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days , were less likely to go back in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase agreement in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for exit from the EU also stressed a spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas has escal@@ ated first , a minus is also possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great support for Volkswagen , is the Chinese market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony got off ably by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a drop from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January to July , Group President Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after upgrading vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer points out a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Monday , VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport confirmed this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully embra@@ ced the requirements of my In@@ qu@@ iry Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations thereof are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Transport , Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting and all type approval relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; warranty , &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a garage for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the loss of the exhaust , as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , VW do not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pun@@ dits from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , it must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund demands this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time now , he has jumped 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now passed on according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the banks of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the C@@ FO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most customers could have understanding and changed to other investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically impossible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks therefore have increased their bank charges , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide remuneration for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele luxuri@@ ously furnished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she jumps money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; is currently not known as other banks , which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative opposite the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition is tough , and the migration of investors is threatening to compete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , customers in Germany will not be pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged loving plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you go to the comment section , to cut it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Al@@ le@@ One men &apos;s middle ages with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the ren@@ aissance of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who recently bought a record , all for@@ esi@@ ght is between 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also not a hormone through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I walked in the middle of a bu@@ stling street in Soh@@ o , I keep my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the heart Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would probably ask the camera man to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : eight young women , three middle @-@ aged women , a woman , presumably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again selling objects he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that those who buy records , are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media country , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would explain the boom of a particular age , to supporters of a particular age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a soothing fellowship of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves , from items that call for happy youth memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet listened to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I am smo@@ other by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put them into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more product @-@ resistant and less music @-@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older people who are coming to a slow pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has a lower audience than I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of New Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ tu@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ aned from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks very lonely , but par@@ ental trau@@ mas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rather makes a window bum@@ per as a big shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives off with a loving si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of sheet music lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I seem to wear the jeans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who attend Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cro@@ sley record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far from that it is impossible to touch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that any attraction for these items signi@@ fies more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in the reality , record shops and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security not with the bum@@ pers through plat@@ ters of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er who sha@@ kes nothing about the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video face
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientific say , that the Greenland shar@@ k has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen , who examined the sh@@ arks , says that the record was with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 27@@ 2 and 5@@ 12 years old and five meters long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should sell 72 temporary stores , sell , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they assumed that the provisional business and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely track@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points , between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places threatened by precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in handy and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts estimated on Friday that the number of migrants in the jungle camp had increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite Olympic disappointment , Martin remains fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to be enter@@ tained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and struggle , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must analyze in peace , which causes would have led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the F@@ WC in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der should be particularly effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futur@@ istically acting Enfor@@ cement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ pol@@ ation there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is comp@@ lied with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days when un@@ interrupted , and the case data is transmitted encrypted using a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be captured across multiple lanes simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variable speed limits and driving b@@ ans by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state @-@ run state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that it is not st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and , by the way , also disappear outside the outer shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold brings
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ odor@@ o Stadium here in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side tap , cr@@ ut@@ ches , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in its form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for UK , but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years ago , under R@@ yan , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they lost one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conclusion will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji started marvel@@ ously , and ra@@ cked the attacks of G@@ Bs in fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. , as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au lifted in the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely set the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ch@@ ub@@ by T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute , Rai@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch@@ down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the start of the game , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learnt to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it is .
GB performed basic changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea In@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB kno@@ cked down in the grass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion of difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown introduced the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and therefore the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the coach of the coach for a rowing victory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no better gold than in those games , and that will mean something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough guys who enter the history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in the history of British Sports who set such a scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th uns@@ killed deployment , which is likewise unprecedented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant athlete who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sponge , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every gold in the herd there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one knew how to survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able , and that &apos;s what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not , it will spread everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio were lucky to start from the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the break to a minimum , in case that was the right term in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ven@@ erable morning to talk more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it repe@@ ats just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training , or a better trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard beat , with which their opponents could not keep up with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very captiv@@ ated at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really important not to get carried away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we weren &apos;t looking to make something great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for one year , before making decisions about his future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next week , Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all so new for me , and I was so stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the water@@ sports association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a while ago , it was called the original sound in a contribution from the Bavarian Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia was damaged by the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe was &quot; Bavarian &quot; far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the association , was 28 years as Managing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he was retired at the age of 65 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes annually about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipalities are Kirch@@ ler , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ jet and was appointed Managing Director of the Association in 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an outstanding event , she named the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and the restructuring of the new fountain ( 1999 ) , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the modernization of water pipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added innovations , because water is the most important food for water and drinking water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has joined himself with a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his purpose , and he lived as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe as a nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , he received a lot of praise and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller has engaged in water management Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the best water@@ keeper , and he was a faithful boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the quar@@ ry at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ ler on a 3rd January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko , soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko , deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the illness was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had progres@@ sed well and now in private in New York where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something two years ago when I sang in La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s relationship with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on partner &apos;s partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a bald head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the man we@@ ars bald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who see Sven S. , will call the 110 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no indications of the death or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we don &apos;t say at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application detachment ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity extraction , are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) said it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Con@@ sole in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiation we could finally reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry charges an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a draft agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG change of 20 percent is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this , too , is not elevated in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our steel campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission rights trade , climate and employment goals are to be weighed , &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the situation escal@@ ated further than the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel into the world market in view of the weak domestic demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers proposed price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect . on the other hand , economic prospects have improved in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear , however , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry responded to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not want to exclude any closures of individual works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2015 , about 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the amount recovered now went back the second month in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , the association expects an increase in orders with an increasing output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a more lively , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to rely on the others , to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense . H@@ ac@@ kler thinks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everyday life , he who demands his lungs is not so fast out of the box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Organis@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia de@@ parts themselves to long @-@ lying events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just elderly people , who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; showing himself : if I practise for something for a long time , I will better and grow beyond myself - strengthening this experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the appropriate offer sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many cities offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the church or the church leader directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing does the soul well , and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats react more sensitive as han@@ go@@ vers to the cries of the young
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ stle of cat babies has on adult animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to her surprise , the male also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equal in the difference to the females . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of cat babies on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they react ten percent faster to caus@@ tic caus@@ tic burns , which are in great need , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary University and Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; han@@ go@@ vers also respond to the calls of kit@@ tens , but always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited youngsters are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ ams were different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of nine adult males and eight female kit@@ tens were observed , from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were played for a call of little ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited kit@@ tens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted in a differentiated way to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they swi@@ vel faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited kit@@ tens turned off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ e with sexual maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , there is again an important football match in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ ni@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the suspension of the exceptional state after the uprising attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , football is not stopped even before football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against former Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but most of the Turks do not have any impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; at public places across the country declared Erdo@@ gan completed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sport is like all the country , divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what unites the Great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ winner &apos;s &quot; Gala , &quot; it will arrive especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as scor@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finished the season in an excellent way , and secured his team to the tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master took a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Vor@@ laps @-@ K.@@ O. in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; say good @-@ bye in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was just about sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protective @-@ King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the occasion of the coup attempt at AC Fir@@ enze , the Gom@@ ez which had been borrow@@ ed by the AC , after the coup attempt , did not return to its European country after the political situation in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to do so , however , the Stür@@ mer must be willing to abandon approximately one third of its estimated rate of 7.5 million euros , &quot; says Or@@ man : &quot; we cannot pay its content in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping , these athletes still have med@@ als for Olympics in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other super@@ l@@ ative athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it , they fight in Rio for med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented her starting rights shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing ban , was amp@@ ly fl@@ atten@@ ed and expelled at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a smiling smile she was still in the hall , provo@@ king with her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst out into a che@@ ering storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start in the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dar@@ ing past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been even faster than ever before . he is the number one in the world over 100 m and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after her taking the pain@@ killer Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having suffered severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion in 2013 and the European Championship , was positively tested on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the intermediate intake and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , accompanied mer@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has been the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an athlete has won so many med@@ als afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Championship title of 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , he reg@@ ained the recognized Bron@@ cem@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record woman and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was first tested in May , but still allowed to start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 29 year old world champi@@ onships , references to taking a banned food supplement were found , the ban of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA dropped mild and expi@@ red on July 13 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bomb enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ del , Friday early . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her home@@ ward journey , she planned for the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether by the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ump@@ a , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , as necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hu@@ a H@@ in , around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further man was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured in police data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ ur@@ on on the southeast coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express himself on possible motives . however , it is likely that the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , said that the attacks were not linked to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is unclear what group is hiding behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police instructed its officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly do not judge tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace , which was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the hom@@ ici@@ dal bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends inspec@@ ting the orders of Thai security authorities on its homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) is applicable to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no longer trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made just a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution , which was dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military a great influence over the years to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos , while the country moves towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , re@@ affir@@ med itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office of constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several regional offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; as evidence for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Chief Executive Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aten of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we observe the movement as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already monitoring the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the decision , Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a juven@@ ile language often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powers of Islam@@ ists as well as the extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own thing , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the propaganda is intended to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , however , we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; , or the Frei@@ taler Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers , refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were established at the regional level , or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the victims of the attack on asylum @-@ shel@@ ters had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that had previously been politically in@@ different , or voted CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have been radically ra@@ dic@@ alized by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always , the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he simply disappeared , no matter how far the cli@@ pping was chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race of 48 seconds and finished 5@@ 9th place on 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was not his athletic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special charter law from the International Swimming Federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is distributed to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media designated him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wealth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he just struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters outdoor style , played no role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the course of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the A@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea swimming pool , when he had to take over 100 metres of outdoor style on his own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics , and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Place has been co@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next morning came back to 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , some 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , a video surveillance is not present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ump sees the im@@ pending electoral defeat not so narrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at a campaign event in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it be nothing with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then heads into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , he doesn &apos;t care : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post increases in trade with electric transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an electric motor vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interest of other companies on the vehicle is apparently great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle , Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of next year , the postal service will also be able to offer their electric vehicles on the free car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has been checking for months whether they are delivered to their self @-@ developed exten@@ der sco@@ oter , delivered with letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post office Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , about by craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter into mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in post @-@ factory manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year and shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very strong step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can imagine , that we changed the entire fleet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gf@@ K leadership reti@@ res after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
consumer research company Gf@@ K shares his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , the Gf@@ K Executive Board wants to leave the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already dischar@@ ged from the supervisory body with effect from September 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ er , over@@ took the management board , shared the company with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a company spokesman did not want to name the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be leading the market research company in future is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in investor circles , it was on Friday , with the shareholders the disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case with BMW , the qu@@ and@@ ts would do it like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter have above all imp@@ acted the decreased value of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good@@ will of 139 million euros , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , led the Group to a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of an accident of a bus with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to sof@@ ten her specifications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stopped right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade dischar@@ ged the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the accident site on the state road 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last passengers were brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner District , P@@ ew@@ sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amounts to 3.@@ 44 instead of until now 2.@@ 10 euros for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh pole 3.@@ 44 instead of so far ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( so far 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a sleep@@ y calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ haus@@ er ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , under@@ coverage was established for these sewage systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ covering basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ thi@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Al@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Administr@@ ative Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ coverage of the previous calculation period must also be compensated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt explained the serious increases in fees resulting from relatively small facilities with a very low waste water supply , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the waste water flow in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses in all three plants , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt indicated that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of low waste water , stone houses made clear that the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance were fully carried out in the three facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in the sewage systems in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , as one could not extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach sewage utility to these facilities because it concerns defic@@ it@@ arian institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first to zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % was recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( December 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % , and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prices remained unchanged at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Eff@@ ect as an Asian cartoon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ sensitive to breeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are un@@ paralleled , property @-@ enhancing tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all ail@@ ments arrive to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , snapshot filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting the application of black face or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this week struck a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and broken che@@ eks , some critics named it a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked themselves , if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was designed as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but outside persons experiencing racism , the filter reminded me of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others opted to anim@@ ate the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose tweet became widespread over the photos , said that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and mil@@ dly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face was drawn into the going lim@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counter@@ parts , could expect more sensitivity to expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; so it is much harder for such things to remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete her Snap@@ chat account , urged others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has left the snapshot largely un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce , and indicates its status as a private company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , it declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel responsible for concentrating on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Command for@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS secret services ; establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual state of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Republi@@ can National Security Task Force , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence Information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly featured a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading mistake in the Cent@@ Com is , to the top , of the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten @-@ page report shows detailed , detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training the Iraqi forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips have given instructions under Obama , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com attorney publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into their lives , after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information , while the investigations will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the general inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence committees published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted admission to IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged moral under analy@@ st and &quot; gave over@@ ly little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday , by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor who were recorded following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these key national defence issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accus@@ ations of the past year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminded of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , had fores@@ een a small occupation troops in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker pointed out that despite the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ co &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general Austin went into retirement in April , and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after winning three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of the people , who keep their doors in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know , however , that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which will remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first placed the strong Dutch will slightly longer walk out of the way , which lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things upside down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work@@ load in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we managed to ro@@ ar the ruin completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door @-@ circle in the first half of the game with a back hand from the close @-@ up area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and drew the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a spe@@ edy relay race between competition and str@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the Tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ bs of women with dimples , could have been built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognised : aerial shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have breast swimming , and may reign long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I find arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se that many of those I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the jumping competition and had an athlete until 2012 , who managed it until the final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an expert enthusi@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ onist trem@@ bling of his never @-@ to @-@ ending impact , but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and do@@ ve , the two sports that essentially uni@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as a spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and o@@ int@@ tos ) before landing on their feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to official program , you will be assessed according to design , difficulty and flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV transmission also another high aim : the world or the Olympic cord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal @-@ directed striving is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also what I perceive as a bit ti@@ ring , even when looking at these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline &apos;s vector is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves upwards , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final round will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round , as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the Olympia Hall , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently hit the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia met by the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a robust ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months , protests against the government have shat@@ tered the country and expanded into more and more territories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Africa International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist hazards beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced and dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile , or sent to prison , or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options out of protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold , regarding the power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a far @-@ critical vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den who were more or less forced in recent years could use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness , after years of falling , explo@@ de under the surface now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed , that they gathered to the protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ered mainly from Ethiopia , in politics and economy while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in secret services , trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content , and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am desc@@ ends from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , apparently by the government , the government was f@@ elled and then stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and that period of un@@ rest was over relatively quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development experts commen@@ ded Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but evi@@ dently , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal affairs of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian town , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common@@ place in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en &apos;s flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she concluded this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states his statement Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that en@@ circles his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tions , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fellow campaig@@ ners to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the alle@@ gation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump told him that he was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by rec@@ alling that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism sp@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to draw the focus of his campaign on account of falling demand points on the economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about Twitter , he warned that Clinton Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics , and then back on demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to the way the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has even assumed an even higher tone because its survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump j@@ okes have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ yards , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and warned them of going around on each of his words and pre@@ occupied with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only one more proof , that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café comes back in Green@@ point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a gay café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , but for 15 years of good coffee served . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people lam@@ inated it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new invention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rever@@ b Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural swe@@ eten@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prizes , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club had closed , she left the coffee dr@@ ink for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that I liked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new additive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before work , and always ordered the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ u@@ ette with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal always receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing bag@@ u@@ ette with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a res@@ ent@@ ment , that the soap business took the old business room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee from the café as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will deal with it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ pointed , also accepted the café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he prepared to turn them out , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new club is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened as the new café , Wh@@ itt found that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ st@@ les felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ecom@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States while the book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which had been in business since the crash of the Stock Exchange in 1929 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ney roast , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap , which extends the ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been like lead in the stomach , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ ws of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War , &quot; A Square Me@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ sa@@ vory ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for many years , has become a rare ser@@ pent luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peculiar mixtures have been tried , since a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication has priority over taste or even healthy cooking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , brick was prepared from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , it was typical for many of the household recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - contributed to the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household relations &quot; and to turn P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers &quot; kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like a million @-@ million man from the world to which he has become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room , and wore a smo@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , today &apos;s leader with no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most desolate places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country was back on its feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had better understood the habits of Bri@@ ck &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick one remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a blow to the wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone showed reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; Some min@@ ced wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he put his own life to help others , Khal@@ ed O@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group who saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people according to the Bild newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard , showing him in an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it made the Syrians a bright symbol of the symbol , in the horror of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicop@@ ters dropped four drums across the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deadly bomb of the Assad regime , had to hit terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate , almost 400 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an examination on board the research ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in 16@@ 24 , it flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland ha@@ arks will only get offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it is barely 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on saturated 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this life span that represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland &apos;s hair was stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the evidence was lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland ha@@ arks are hard to watch , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they measured their time @-@ motion , when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another one swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which are tor@@ mented out of higher water layers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two little sh@@ arks had a noticeable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the l@@ enti@@ l had a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , all major Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cul@@ us , producing cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centimet@@ re Greenland , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the researchers could assign an age to the length . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland ha@@ ie with its increase obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , this should be world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , caught a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip on the neck , was caught before Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there also runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , they mature later - and age slower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume increases much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the heat loss of one gram of mouse is much larger than one gram of elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; says the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building site in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent session , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board approved the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the development , plot and settlement questions were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons for surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Street &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer available for interested parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality is convinced that the building areas in rural and quiet residential community , Schö@@ nau attract young families and pen@@ sion@@ ers alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said , volunteers can announce themselves in the Town Hall right away . the Municipal Council is expected to advise its members on its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to also respond to other commercial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of Lower @-@ time , the area already indicated is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city on the Main offers the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W competence field and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether the banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to be approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what large US banks are using .
several banks have already announced plans to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk mandate ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of fact , Luxemburg under@@ mines a large fund sector , but just as well as Dublin in infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the town with slightly available commercial properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands at number seven , Luxemburg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power relations : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gilead maintains direct costs of hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a US magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal costs , resulting from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , including Mein@@ l and other im@@ moral actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the complaint on Thursday , US Ambassador Beth@@ any Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed mutual ownership and property on laboratory work , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supported by the US , troops say they have re@@ conquered total control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the US @-@ supported troops , total control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j was rec@@ ap@@ tured near Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city , said a spokesman for the group on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have dig@@ ged within the city , the Syrian Arab forces are currently comb@@ ating the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they released over 2,000 civilians , kept by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clean @-@ up operations , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Pres@@ idential candidate and her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in speech recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his promises to date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , led to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax tests were not completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spur@@ ts Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , asking the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no taxes for two years for two years , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax check , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clinton Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 tax declaration showed that it claimed only USD 100 of its income , unlike the majority of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their main investment was a cost effective index fund , from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ illi powder and fireworks promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ illi powder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fies its support by exercising volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friday is a wel@@ com day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities that they could keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without harm , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant , with a torch and blowing in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the spark plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ illi in the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , a touch is usually sufficient to chase the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a last chance is a gol@@ fer who is shooting a fireworks fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal coun@@ cill@@ or unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects take part in the businesses with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail trade in the core city is still considered to be significantly exp@@ and@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the motion for the new building of a commercial ski room on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bel@@ Kon@@ s under construction declined unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we generally welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine shore , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pres@@ election because it would have called Arab guests according to an employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anno@@ y@@ ance at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann visited Israel at the hotel &apos;s country code list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel is eliminated and wi@@ ped ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an explanation , the director looked at the hotel reception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he got there , &quot; shock him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it solved even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a major dis@@ grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ and@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them sign@@ posted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all alle@@ gations of herself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police introduce tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they assembled to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began when the police tried to break apart the students , which led the police to put on rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred students participated in the demonstrations , in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president , Michel Tem@@ er on walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in the streets went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lifting of sanctions grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent according to Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade offset between Moscow and Teher@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country has grown rapidly , distributed by the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent , compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation made some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to witness : inf@@ estation of beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ bery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the am@@ bush of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had killed their faces were pulled out by the staff of the drink market and then escaped first by foot and then presumably by a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money was captured , the police do not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , thus relatively small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beverage market is directly accessible from the market deck of the Re@@ we market , and is poorly accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the attack , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the parking house entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ ch@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have been observed at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should report urgently to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nag@@ old : game and fun during summer time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old , with their assistants on their summer free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quiet hamlet of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first week of the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ TB with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ z@@ oos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days , the group at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gastronom@@ ically , children and assistants were treated with their own meals like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in workshops , beautiful jewelry is made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of hom@@ ecom@@ ing , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ ef@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch of St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next roman@@ ic@@ arri@@ es of all mini @-@ stran@@ ts in probably two years , the minister &apos;s round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year was offered a special pilgrimage destination on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms arose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening before Fr . Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Our Lady stood and so the pilgrimage was started by the Min@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made an attempt to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgri@@ m book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the overnight stays , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller , for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , we went to Gü@@ te@@ bach on the second day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , one stepped up the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly relieved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral later in the afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by the operator Markus Ober@@ t welcomed the Min@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , there was still time for the dioc@@ ese metropolis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner sha@@ ved last night in men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London railway world champi@@ onships in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did this in time , as a sign up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner comp@@ eted in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prevailed in the first lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap , Hin@@ des was tight , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du as they climbed onto the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just here to do my best , and make a name for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we installed an Olympic Board and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du claimed that he was intentionally falling on the track after a weak start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he with@@ drew this statement later , and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three months , we have come together as a team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been so badly hit with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ uta , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same for Ho@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ mile four kilometer race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had disputed before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK team relies on its strong railway team , to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a pair of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a truly exceptional display of absolute domination in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ mas played in the background , such as the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mos@@ quit@@ oes and the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
future of the melt mill of Port@@ land based on the lifting of energy consumption question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the system operator termin@@ ates the supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy , established for 20 years , exp@@ ires in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land , are at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect , could be at risk in closing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , since the melt mill uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Al@@ co@@ a melt in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina . the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p maintain small proportions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further stated that the contracts were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force starting in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracts have a 12 months notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the pre@@ dictions of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already depreci@@ ated from $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; A@@ bility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or supply the electricity to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that 2010 concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts are warning about the potential closure of Port@@ land melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago will consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if both systems were to disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it would not be good for us as a generating set , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ on@@ ward and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ ed plot almost every birthday sep@@ is@@ ode of a kids show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls somehow at this publicity city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , safety began with a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue cover was concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Vo@@ gue , the September edition is the most sold edition of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were 6@@ 15 pages of advertisement ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure of his cover stars is expected so eag@@ erly that over the last two years , pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before official announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; model &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer La@@ wrence was on the cover in 2013 after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even though everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are really talented women , who are in the entertainment industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enny &apos;s position was always somewhat tense in the world of fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings stir up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , it seems to pass by the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves , on their pay@@ wall apps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter , to the LOVE magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her spare time she can be seen in Reality TV , probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; annually , annually 160@@ ,000 people reject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the countries &quot; need for assistance are rejected annually by the Municipal Building Centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further medium @-@ sized transactions on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair delay and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality &apos;s legal services , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Assembly of Community Cultural Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been rejected each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that without the abolition of the decision of the federal government , the situation would only become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems with legal nature and this elevation shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June 2017 , the German government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Adju@@ st@@ ment Ministers and sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the regional government met its commitment to raise funds for granting legal assistance to the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of staff allegedly drew weapon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action , when she was told that her campaign director for North Carolina had a fire@@ arm directed to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident was described in an indictment filed by the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally , before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and took his course to Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knees , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charges come only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms lovers should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign was clear that the media had torn his words from the context , and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and Philip for bodily injuries and ab@@ iding mental damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a comment , Tr@@ ump Press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President , Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before Länder elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute In@@ sa , for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances of continuing the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD left 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent more than five years ago to 24 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the poll@@ s , the party was only margin@@ ally close to the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would go to 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite moderate losses , the Green Party was back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite moderate losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey in Berlin , the survey was only 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U only achieved 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they still smile behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would miss it in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the followers dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would last for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet portal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months before , at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , as an &quot; office in the Western pocket format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browsers , although slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the average sales price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one could guess in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile sector experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , vendors master the market who all came later than Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being online always and everywhere , today it is everyday for a lot of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless App vendors and telecommunications companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march , still today , is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors , such as Samsung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years after its invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on average , every German now looks for his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , permanent availability is regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , as well as in 2012 in London , when we were doing a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and provide an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the Games , and that we will am@@ end ourselves on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not a single infrastructure project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn to natural growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB , and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding advertising blocking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cra@@ b and mouse game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displaying block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop site would change coding about its ads to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of what part of the advertisement is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the nar@@ r@@ ator of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been in progress since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into battle , is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display block@@ ers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook seems worthwhile to invest in such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would actu@@ alize its &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference ool &quot; to have more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman for Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have focused on Develop@@ ing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over people &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss highway over@@ ride
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the night , the victim was on the highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday , the police calls on witnesses for a supposed suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49 , who was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , asking these and every witness of the incident to report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative investigation was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the motorway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and was unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call - was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists at the God@@ dar@@ d Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ ared with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet turned slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow turn of Venus expon@@ ents its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their oceans evapor@@ ated , and their water vap@@ or was burned off by ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as its Hydro@@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the same as we know it today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and introduced a small co @-@ determination right for the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions , which affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ r , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he did for our organization , and we wish him only the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season , Roy received the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the league title as the best coach of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference at five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pot workers resume talks , putting on strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labor struggles regarding remuneration for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all dispute parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , said negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Unions agree that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter@@ tops in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company &apos;s rating agency follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors , in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts will give the company the space required to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities with the British energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &apos; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work@@ flows that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the ple@@ j@@ ade cluster
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates , among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ er understand why stars are rotating at different rates in the cluster , and in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are with the development of the planets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ lings , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the birth of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years , from the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are turning now fastest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at peak rotation rates , these ri@@ pping stars po@@ ise large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates , that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while bigger stars slowly rotate pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we want to know more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , than the US bas@@ eball star in prime time from base to base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game atten@@ de@@ es of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) and the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mile@@ stones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should still not be recorded in the Hall Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field , was so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted , between 2001 and 2003 , to have banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect , for years having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his farewell days , too , were not sil@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends played the big stage again in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit often on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails an attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az and given the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Or@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi and Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an er@@ ased athlete , almost one medal , would have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle runner from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and ruled out immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed light athle@@ tics competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Sunday , Ch@@ en has demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de which is used as a mask for dop@@ ing substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court , CA@@ S , confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m of free style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , he applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the night of Rio the news filtered through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , while the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it is alleged that the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act on the forbidden substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should have already been positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov so@@ aked in reply immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t have the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing loaded nation must not take part in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both of them dispute the seizure , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting the athletes , particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Federation of IA@@ AF banned the entire Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of swimming , previous tensions in China were also cat@@ ered for intense discussions among athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping stock@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Data@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ma@@ iled h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , programmers from black@@ mail malware attack companies - and they are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have at least once been victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the ran@@ som required by perpetrators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators considerably speci@@ alize attacks in company networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently witn@@ essing a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks was terri@@ fying in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ altered files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get the final code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the damage is higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetrators &quot; demands in the face of stagn@@ ation in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ack@@ ers , on the other hand , know this and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure researchers have examined the use and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , address freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus vendor SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more likely , however , it is three or four people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the programmers then sell their malware , in the form of a software module to the real black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes a adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ sts then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typically , criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 50 percent of the IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , trust them to be able to ward off Ran@@ som@@ ware via file back @-@ ups and scanner software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the offen@@ ders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz @-@ Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offen@@ ders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V acts rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top drops off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is available in the storage compartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests , but there is the magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seating areas of the rear bench can be folded up like chin @-@ chairs , providing storage that is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V due to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide re@@ v ranges very powerful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he should do his job somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steering is , however , a bit more direct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested Top version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because in manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the smart template re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition , and throt@@ tles the speed when needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two USB and HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest , making it a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable with danger , typical of aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of the fall , the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease risk : when pays the organis@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their trip , they only get money back if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ ful in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness returned to a defective treatment plant , supposedly polluted by sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had the view that the trip had been insufficient , and compla@@ ined against the organizers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the organizer only knew about leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hurt his obligation of information , thus the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the samples of water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disease of multiple hotel guests , possibly due to infection among each other , belongs to the general risk of living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ utely react to terrorist hazards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if convic@@ ted criminals had to leave the country more quickly , however , this increases security and also strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; medium @-@ sized four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is supposed to be improved and the weapon law has been am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last much @-@ discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is supposed to be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of citizens , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers better social support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister has clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel spoke to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union for a ban on discrimination and the abolition of double citizenship before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers a general ban on full @-@ wear in constitutional law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can talk about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party in Sim@@ one Peter threw out the Minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorism act and ability to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring the people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway bridge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ umps regularly on the street , here &apos;s a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy must be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good news for all truck drivers driving in traffic on the ambient street every evening in the traffic jam , when they drive over the highway junction ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Strasse , at 700 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer street , right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main advantage is that traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the manifold section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the districts representing Mu@@ enster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers nerv@@ ously on the feeder are annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her trail and sometimes also beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason is the needle hole on B 51 , shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from here , traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second track had to be rebuilt in a good , three @-@ quarters years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : stati@@ cal calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to record heavy duty traffic in two lanes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected work@@ day traffic will continue , the competent state will not be able to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official residual use period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal permit , the state operation deliberately chose the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because of disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic was passed on to the construction site on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students visited the little house between eleven and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association promoting cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background has given the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the youngsters in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , the N@@ ima company , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are expected to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers for children and families in theatre play , theatrical language education are planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of stars : hope for a better weather
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south @-@ west of Germany , the weather has made a strike in the south @-@ west of Germany by the bill on Friday - but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the shooting stars , Per@@ sei@@ ds are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing night : advice to sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , one rolls around for hours , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep before the alarm bell ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is all , but relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleeping problems arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be under@@ pinn@@ ed by Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of directors of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ filtr@@ ating and sleeping disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , a member of the board of the German Association of Industrial Hem@@ p , says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can include organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it can be , that several factors are bed@@ ding one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disk failure can be bad , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and possibly starts thinking about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s one example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when should you sleep with a doctor ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impairment can look very different : one is worn out , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , low @-@ lowered medical exam@@ in@@ ers are unlikely to emphas@@ ise Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be clari@@ fied with studies , if the problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , for example when snor@@ ing with respiratory therap@@ ists , in case of path@@ ological sleep@@ iness or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , one does not have to prepare for the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ ather on the finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a camera on the ceiling to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can victims get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite a lot of screws , where you can sleep for better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it counts on : regular sleep and raising times , do not sleep too long , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and not at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not really condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself to the dis@@ ap@@ pointing tri@@ mming of the DS@@ V @-@ team at Olymp@@ is , via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he first took gold at the short @-@ track world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the former DS@@ V Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € relief and no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate so closely with dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ties would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is exactly how it should be held with countries , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled for some time prior to WM / OS by independent directors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Det@@ ach@@ ments arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , two women were arrested and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suspect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage pil@@ es as a gang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 9.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang known to polic@@ emen of past anti @-@ theft crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and had been in a community , working stiff and very professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the crime department 34 can demonstrate four actions to thi@@ eves , who had been specifically in charge of the crimes committed to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in appears at first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted nursery and a beer shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house , someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed shortly , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate firm of Friedrichsha@@ in , is preferred over the past few weeks , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are rooms occupied and used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a point of departure of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after three weeks of official statements , the police pat@@ ched up parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ smi@@ ths , with 300 police officers on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , construction workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown house owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal and a day later , police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are especially generic from the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a neighborhood , which is mostly a police guard against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; domestic occup@@ ations and the living projects have been part of the neighbourhood for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at dump@@ ed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been thrown into colour bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body violation , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the crimes perpet@@ u@@ ate damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the famous burning cars , directly in the ri@@ gs , do no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it was so important to her that residents get back their streets : from police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the significance of the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road is still taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps that the old inhabitants would disp@@ lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - people who are not so well @-@ drunk , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should we do , if someone never listen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of those drawn with dy@@ es , the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you pull out , you should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area to complain about noise there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons , only presented with the first name , have asked not to be called with their correct name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social worker supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees herself as a contact for all protag@@ onists : refugees , working group Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and who else is involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers of honour are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here : the en@@ ig@@ matic wo@@ olen waters that have a problem above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , some - less spot@@ ting than the multitude of desired tasks - had meant purpos@@ efully - mean that the administration wanted to write down the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , an en@@ viable wo@@ olen cloth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ces supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new containers will soon be in the washing line
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been to find housing for the connection refugees for some time , which have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the connection setting , the municipalities are responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must submit the refugees in their own or rented living rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the responsibility changes from the district office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , the search has been very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , unless one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , communal apartments must be made as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , soon new containers will be installed in the washing line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only with dwell@@ ings it is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a firm lead there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be bra@@ zen or set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people work in the building yard or help home masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , activity does not only mean labor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so here , administration and volunteers also jump here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach cannot work and be useless , he will never integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , problem cases exist , customers are honest , &quot; people in which nothing is wrong . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ ces and the customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already an &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , have the two fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customers clearly stated that what some nai@@ vely may call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in retri@@ bution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the local and volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , politics atro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the authors are already at full capacity , to integrate the previous human beings in a reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters wanted
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about an hour , the police helicopter flew several areas - un@@ successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants surprised the two , and struck the b@@ oul@@ ders into the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded bu@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prosec@@ ute the police , the police deployed several stri@@ kers as well as a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fal@@ si@@ fication proceeded without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eventually , the unknow@@ ns fell close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police identified after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attack on a Ul@@ m I@@ mb@@ iss , the police are investigating six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker environment because of severe land@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , there is a dispute in the Ul@@ m ro@@ cker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
