<seg id="11">"" "" "" "only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was terrifying in recent months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for unaltered files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmail." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "in order to get the final code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case, people were in danger of life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "" "" "in a recent study, F-Secure researchers have examined the use and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money." "" "" ""</seg>
