<seg id="11">"" "" "" "first of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in recent months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "these files encrypt the ransomware, and deletes the originals sustainably." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case, people were in danger of life." "" "" ""</seg>
