Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel , bringing Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal made by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the Congress of the Republi@@ cans before the Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had declined with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , he was admitted to having shot his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cri@@ p@@ pled on a white block : &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already travelled 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ Emplo@@ ye@@ es heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lamb motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students said they were looking forward to their lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee an automatic way to an adjustment as a Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions , which Lamb can no longer answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs off later when he came back into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before being arrested , lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ sto@@ l in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb began its work at the university in 2009 , which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , taught geography and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the spring of pedago@@ gy , he did his doc@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and the lamb was 20 , when they met by mutual friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time he was the black women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and inhabitants of Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played the blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and A@@ big@@ ail occurred three years ago , both on a summer carnival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played together the one or other gig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ d Night at night 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no sign of something wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were in the elevator , and we were jo@@ king together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ or &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ enk@@ wache , while the Univers@@ it@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that Lamb made the emergency call after having shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call was calling Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there was no indication that the two had ever married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ ys R Us says it will not be so many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start with application interviews this month , and the number of employees will rise from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer and companies prepare to hire temporary workers to equip retailers with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox sh@@ j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and I gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is &quot; for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be on display on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the dis@@ closures in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation dis@@ solu@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey results which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten , say they have a negative opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these figures are in early states , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with jump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when J@@ eb Bush was the favorite of the establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ ump &apos;s temp@@ er , not a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number applies in the first country State of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his mandate and say almost six out of 10 Independent saying that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they expose their guar@@ dians , republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July , put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , GO@@ P voters didn &apos;t have the clear@@ est crystal ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters want to look at the campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Republi@@ cans are gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the frag@@ mented field probably contributes to jumps leadership , while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvested health support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has 14 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before margin Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have won their votes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they had to leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for dump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with jump on the subject of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump mentioned in his election campaign two months ago from Mexico &apos;s &quot; rapi@@ sts , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs on new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support from republi@@ can constitu@@ ents is eliminated , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re also fur@@ ious about Washington , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago showed that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans at the Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the Hob@@ by@@ en@@ weg , you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea resort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; meaning the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices comes from the same as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ er published a ranking of the most exclusive German home locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro per square meter , well marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way : Munich , for example , is not at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double Tor@@ shake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a successful hit by Thomas M√ºller took the way to a earned 3 : 0 hit at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus , then it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in Bayern , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90 . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8 . ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his 28th hits in the Champions League , M√ºller received good assistance from Olympic champion go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who passed a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a focused and dedicated performance , without glit@@ tering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent home matches in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , in seven European Championship du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but in their offensive efforts , they often go to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often triggered by a game shift on left @-@ wing blast Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M√ºller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ eck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion announced the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Brown hit the Pol@@ es &apos; header from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Bav@@ arians stri@@ pped their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to set needle boots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the door@@ keeper of Manuel Neu@@ er , however , it was prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before New Zealand , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing the final training , said sports president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear about 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller made another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this creates a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good news : at ren@@ unciation , risk sin@@ ks quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smoking smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists had observed more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tooth loss is the main cause of tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y infections in smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , but write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , Ref@@ lec@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , explained Dr. H@@ einer &apos;s instructor at DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our knowledge , leads to good dental health until high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany over 20 per cent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness is affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study reinfor@@ ces the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , archaeological finds have been found on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is continually being added as a specialist for archae@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found their location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents it has already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman died in the train station in Spirit @-@ shat@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police is asking the people for assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the platform , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was seized by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the acquisition of the train , the Federal Police has carried out serious injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on site , she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal equ@@ ation of the young woman , no evidence is available to the moder@@ ating officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident might have been observed by witnesses , or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , B@@ Ziegel@@ stra√üe , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the cause of the accident can be given under the hot@@ line of the Federal Police under Phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU Commission nomin@@ ates new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to strengthen the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration arrangements for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cec@@ ili@@ a Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has before introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to develop with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shall come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to lodge an objection against sentences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , and there was no claim against their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , and commented on Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , establishing tax pa@@ yers for tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act compla@@ ined that EU Commission proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it was critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the reform of major points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , took into account in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als may be of the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of this , the business association of business Europe warned of restric@@ ting the possible options for the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this deadline is no longer available .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy girl @-@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us about various places , which he always records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and tender arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be wonderful cre@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can always be dri@@ fting towards the great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it creates rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a das@@ hed line : each of the 50 US states should be sung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans has already appeared and has a positive effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year later , the musician living in New York comes back to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album asc@@ ends to the ameri@@ can bil@@ l@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage decoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the glo@@ om@@ ily held Hamburg city , More ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens become much more mature back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without speaking a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays themselves through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thanks a little bit , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture Deb@@ ut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour President , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise himself up for the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some meetings , to leave them to colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , Labour &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News night programme , he advised the Labour President to sing the national an@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow mini @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s team , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within the Labour market , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 ¬£ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ meworks will be confronted with a tac@@ tile and that he has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the move .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea that other colleagues may take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch venue . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; shot in Job@@ Fair &quot; : homeless people trained to photographers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the centre of Johannes@@ burg is a very hard place , if one is homeless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a group of former street children found a way to learn a skill , and to earn a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am taking shot in Job@@ Fair &quot; ( I was shot in Job@@ Fair ) is a non @-@ profit studio that teaches homeless people how to take photos from their surroundings and achieve a profit .

Po@@ und Incre@@ ases Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , the result of excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and advanced estimates of the timing of an interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , when Riv@@ age AB In@@ Be@@ v was offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and assemble brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - back growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares in the Mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s achieved his assessment of the rating for &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees means &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on Bi@@ eber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ pp@@ ie 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with cro@@ o@@ cher FR@@ IS@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros , heavy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more or more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the generation of U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ valve construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my wi@@ ki would have to sit in high school in the tenth grade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to pay for school ?
who &apos;s it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even , the bi@@ valve itself does not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that has cat@@ ered out anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for advertising in the advertising break of the Super@@ war , he cas@@ hed three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company , many dollars on the bi@@ valve account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with every pupp@@ et that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also assimil@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber is drinking a coffee , you wonder at the window window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e g@@ inge goes too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others stress , Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster is a Lebanese idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both - in the potato d@@ √∂n@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ew@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the shop has a barbecue sk@@ ew@@ er , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the idea has registered the Lebanese patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility patent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wers contain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with its customers , culinary international understanding is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash starts Con@@ soli@@ dation campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor standing campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on@@ board , brands like ice makers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops , and shop owners selling dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor strategy day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , not@@ orious Provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab about five percent of the market in these two countries after opening his first markets and take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ a of Morgan Stan@@ ley said that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million in sales per year and met@@ a cash from $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that over the next year , Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in the food and food business and the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around ‚Ç¨ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business decreased by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s have declined by 43 percent since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ ed and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programs on El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return again for the first time in four years , again for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association , Steve He@@ aly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious engagement with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp was scre@@ ened by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the Individu@@ al behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my opinion th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into conflict , He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who broke a bat from fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even in the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated somewhat too severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that Nick made very quick progress on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the states , and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but frustr@@ ations were rising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants entered the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them declined from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it is unacceptable that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels not to reconci@@ le common immigration policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the migr@@ ated Italy and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , making it possible to shut down streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even prisoners were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; said President Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament still has to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor to Or@@ ban , said that 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to penetrate there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter into Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eled for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders back only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , however , has a major advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections nationwide , say they would support Clinton if it were nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it , because it &apos;s the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six percent would not support it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter , it would support them enthusi@@ astically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the nomin@@ ee is the most common answer that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) and that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ bility is quoted as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential election , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked by the election , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bianca decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; percentage has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some key characteristics of voters in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the three candidates Bi@@ den is best cut off when hon@@ esty , while clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den concep@@ ologically in line with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still portrayed as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not influenced overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of them saying that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded as sincere and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent consider it to be honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 per cent of the elec@@ tive holders do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of voters vote nationwide as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good guidance notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ esty , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for sample sample of 3@@ 51 democratic elec@@ tors in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is on the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the new pol@@ l and others are dramatically lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the support grows from 23 % in the latest C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same period , Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ received in demographic groups , sur@@ passing Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is at the lowest , from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the jump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed a jump in front of Car@@ son , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found some side thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing tourists to find warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a maximum of 17 degrees , a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east there is even up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges were filed against 5 persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft captured the brut@@ ality of Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said he had been loaded with attached eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about head@@ aches and then he fell unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and set the well @-@ being of the br@@ other@@ hood about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh with a bl@@ unt force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the sham@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s Family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e suggested an indictment for the murder of the third counts , for the first five members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization officially or in@@ official - we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will happen , when the F@@ ed increases interest rates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest is coming , and the house will be shaken , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how business and financial investments are responding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , however , market participants could see that all the fuss was exagger@@ ated because of a rate rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a look at historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen by the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things for a while volatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that income yields may be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is usually upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase @-@ in cycle , and the rate of return begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point , with a raise of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 net interest increases were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê ‚ïê
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants reviewed the F@@ ed &apos;s interest all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could enable an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increase cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions put itself very fast after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of bonds , the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the return on loan will fall , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates leads to the return of yields between long and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve has increased and volati@@ lity has increased , and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and large part of the country , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market , as well as the financing of their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s Analy@@ st said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with strong record accounts exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of the pure pool games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains through higher earnings even if experts in different opinion are how quickly this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter because of its stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also went to BBC Music Awards and said , that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the voice of The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , a leading member of parliament and boo@@ sts new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private trans@@ mit@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the publicly @-@ leg@@ ged radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also went to BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you are trying to do something different , these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er on the public when it did in the past , because the British were less informed of classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that fell during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million ¬£ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insisted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to en@@ close the order of other series of The Voice in the future or spend money from fees for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales grow three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed spending the expenses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth rate in the year 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; says Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales grew three years ago , when buyers began working with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now this is happening , and we may experience that growth will be less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday @-@ Phen@@ om@@ enon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buying purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of ¬£ 5,000 a little more than ¬£ 1 was spent online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the city centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca on the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims on the first funeral in Mec@@ ca , by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collapsed in Mek@@ ka &apos;s great mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gri@@ eving filled , largely clothed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procession went past the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then collapsed on the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 dec@@ ern who were killed as a crane collapsed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual p@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ lers will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane should not have stopped when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news agency service in English did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company would be prohibited abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the great mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who later this month took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the breakdown of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s great mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late Al Qaeda leader , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was an ab@@ rupt son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government representatives ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) had to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other wounded , half of this amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time for cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British are increasingly occupied by arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has increased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to the opening of 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points of sale nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that Br@@ its hold their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European arti@@ sans , who carry out the work in their home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you are apparently a minority nowadays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Br@@ its employ more and more craftsmen to perform home@@ work in their homes , leading the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ √©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her who has the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices has now out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight of ten purchase decisions were made by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of the five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also rev@@ amped her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year earnings and turnover , after the Group had deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally released in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel emerged in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of association accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he covers the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials , too , are charged with financial years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact was the chair of the Sho@@ vel@@ ing Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence assumed that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials had counted only expense reimbur@@ sement and the sports club , for whom they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the passi@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the payment of expenses for reimbur@@ sement of expenses was eff@@ ected retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the reimbur@@ sement demands was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when an asset had been on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , pau@@ lin and not detail @-@ cancell@@ ations appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and dic@@ tion@@ aries managed the two accused together , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of financial contributions ; it is important that the freedom of debt has been important , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , a total of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were the def@@ endants , declared the def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account was based on the name of the second accused and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know a long answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best thing for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first accused , however , declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the association had never been damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he charged 1,000 euros a month to the club , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , exact documents for the early years were not indic@@ ative of the def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were no longer kept , after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ dom@@ eter money was also referred to as the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the com@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his place of residence on the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ ables another 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the pay@@ roll that has been running for three years , the terri@@ ese will cut off other jobs at the company &apos;s split@@ ting up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ Sto@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not have an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company &apos;s customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) were saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share gave 2.3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , currently sp@@ li@@ ts itself up in a new society - separated from the future @-@ oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after his services , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP responds with a split up and massive positions on changes in the sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and do more and more transactions online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , Whit@@ mans re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings envis@@ age the breakdown of around 5@@ 5,000 positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tili@@ ties in Iraq would , however , largely reject rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 per cent agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles and electro@@ mobility until the 27th of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers of the car association V@@ DA expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ ted on Serbian @-@ Hungarian borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke T@@ r√§n@@ eng@@ as and water@@ front , against several hundred displaced refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence erup@@ ted at the border control point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it , a police line was formed and a water@@ jet was set up behind the polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the officials proceeded with continuous pe@@ pper@@ y spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereafter , the police used tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have withdrawn from now somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees were sin@@ king in themselves , and suffered from breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest has been raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will continue to do so and now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historic event , since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has put interest on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of service , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook to global proportions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good for such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death cont@@ ests at the Delta State University , Le@@ ading Exc@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning and before he later shot his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; he could do it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , Professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said he shot someone , and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call center , that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but nobody will distur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss who owned a dog named Light@@ ning had met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later at that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , a Ph@@ .@@ D. thesis on the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this , certainly , calls for its tribute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa construc@@ ts the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lufthansa Group plans to save a half billion euros in the year alone , with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the globally around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lufthansa construc@@ ts its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings to cheap , cheap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , there will be no more management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as possible , the cheap airlines Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the new order , Spo@@ hr emphas@@ ises the significance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the planned strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the wings concept is the &quot; Wings &quot; saving concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that Lufthansa planes reloc@@ ate routes to the group @-@ own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South , &quot; the paintings of Le@@ ena Kr√º@@ ger can be seen in the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White Hall of the House , the Finnish @-@ based Finn@@ in has put together a selection of tit@@ ular works that encourage their viewers to move thou@@ ght@@ fully on their journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United is not able to play Mon@@ el@@ ang for months , because of double frac@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this gave the left outside defense to cry and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field , and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ek@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps one day later , and then underwent surgery in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then played fantastic , and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al assumed , that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am . my way to recovery begins now . I come back stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related : Manchester United is losing the loss of Luke Sha@@ w , during the PS@@ V defeat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very badly with it , I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado has also been taken to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all beautifully and well except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , re@@ stores the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ row @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if this is not suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron partly reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ row @-@ Ville then a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he agrees to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be familiar with the story of the book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said , that the text probably had come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but no further comments were made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclude a revers@@ ing victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims related to this : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to skip Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago one would have extended the run of ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he hopefully turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.@@ K. coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss fi@@ gured his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t bring so good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s mostly a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test man gets to put his mark , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be claimed was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist whom I set up high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place which hit us very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this obviously depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to leave mo@@ een beside Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and got four Qui@@ cks , showed up and I did nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as a op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he immediately made it , and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see its statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England made some smart supplements at the coaching station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ en , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ches of the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and a powerful deployment into the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ab@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit UK from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u , if the economy enters into a noisy machine by 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard on Tuesday because of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ aten@@ sian state recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always made up of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prime minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who looks after Britain outside the EU tent inside the EU tent , says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is cau@@ tious but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it has been done for the over@@ drives like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) and cab@@ bage ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French President Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zzling power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to imagine that they will be tear@@ ing up a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to avoid Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments on the SN@@ P style while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press office in 1975 but did not have our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all its cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , phone h@@ ack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als most of our big newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , ban@@ anas are better distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band became more Bla@@ ir himself as Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the adopted constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened a back@@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has never forgiven him , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste more for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe , I press it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild gra@@ dations of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ness can say yes to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s nom@@ ination of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but struggling to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media ; a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambigu@@ ities for EU membership - in line with her current issue - is not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its ambigu@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking , resulting from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grab@@ bed the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J , asking whether the asser@@ tions can be based on stones or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to describe their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose management was previously announced by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector funding in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , also the tobacco line of p@@ he took part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work suggests that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage of most products by most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers were premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s statements have already been responded to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long rob@@ ber dies in his addiction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ enders , former Chief of Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like E@@ ast@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which also clearly showed un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as wide support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the most popular shows of BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like E@@ ast@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that BBC should check their thi@@ an mission to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television channels in Australia and Canada .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , be@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ worms generally do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels , and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed m@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and metro trains , which require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15th to 18th September with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the D@@ LR line which turns into the image of a tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a flock of arms dealers will drive with the D@@ LR ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name special Pat@@ rol Group helped with distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; which claims that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet is maintained . &quot;

many artists turn to work with activists in protest movements and realize they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency who works as a non @-@ profit organization with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic double @-@ minded company advertising , but &quot; by the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step towards the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art related to the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors scra@@ m@@ ble fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgetting 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and many long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of what I have learned , can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance to the residence hall extends from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where and where you have Sab@@ bat@@ n , and why you are honest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and put their under@@ wear on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related : don &apos;t think about getting into university , with a relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone trying to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I hold back the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to sense when a fellow student is full of soci@@ ability , and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
making friends through baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s . welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves , and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poorly mixed g@@ ags of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not make any noise , which stops people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , if it was a matter of making them a bit more quiet at three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ acted to this , with even lou@@ der music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she dropped her own music , shut her door and set off for her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future spouse accidentally move into the same residence hall ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be fundamentally embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them and see them again and see them every day , and perhaps witness how she transfers all common friends to yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your under@@ body a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never aw@@ aken any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but don &apos;t pack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees ; single @-@ educational and low @-@ income ear@@ ners
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced house huts for people , who don &apos;t have much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the ear@@ ring servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build better and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly beneficial housing can be created : in a project , he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the people , however , remain a big part here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space over the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey nursery is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different , if you put people in blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seekers each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building law I have correctly dra@@ fted my project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially complicated , it always makes the threat of Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the post@@ nat@@ al regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
y it is sp@@ ook@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still subordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the cities , there is no place for that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asylum seekers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but luxury dwell@@ ings that hardly could afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ser@@ er alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build , even today , cheap and well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what it is all about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner ( 44 ) studied micro@@ systems technology in Regensburg , initially focusing on environmental analyses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by using a special tool to delete apps , and then re @-@ install them as soon as the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton just one motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup second stressed that I had nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 53 points separate the vice @-@ champion in Singapore before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday , defending champion and double champion Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and won the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for days , a Dun@@ st@@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbour island Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club Bad Kis@@ singen , founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Intelligence Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the city .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ dorf looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ ov &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; centre have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social fund and opened up a new agency at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and care insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often care members can be left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of the funds are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ova and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offerings from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally complementary .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention and prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Executive Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both entrepreneurs see demographic change in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg , in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated itself to the unification of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ etal gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the social fund is making a major contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors are able to live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg against W√ºrzburg Ki@@ ckers , October 6 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is official : after re@@ development at the Fu@@ ch@@ asse Stadium , the appointment for the match FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg was not yet established against the third @-@ party W√ºrzburg Ki@@ ckers , the date of October 6 was set as an appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting of the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the eighth @-@ fin@@ als of the Bavarian football team , tot@@ op@@ ok@@ als against the third @-@ party FC W√ºrzburg Ki@@ ckers , was finally completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be played on Tuesday , October 6 at the Bam@@ berg Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ sta@@ dion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning security , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z H√º@@ mmer , who also points to the now started ticket sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our team , it is something special to play against a third party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , not without reason , because Fl@@ ut@@ light games have a special charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg drew attention to 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schwein@@ furt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winner of the competition will receive 5,000 Euros and quali@@ fies for the first round of the DF@@ B balance @-@ cup 2016 / 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus was shared on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus awards a honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after World War II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
parking : Tim Wiese re@@ jects polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese is noticed in Bremen , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foot@@ b@@ aller was once , now Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ h√º@@ ter was engaged in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass he has added over the past two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , he did not acknowledge intellectu@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bremen &apos;s city center , meadow had just cut off the hair when he saw a parking space guard exhibited a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , meadow stor@@ med from the shop , insul@@ ted the civil servant , and threw her in front of her feet as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the exam , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only then will I decide whether a meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and struck him with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a rup@@ ture of the nose , bleeding heavily from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as his two friends rus@@ hed and looked at the bat , this first let him fall off his victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to the apartment , and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an increase in head@@ count , the victim appears on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wounded must be taken to hospital in order to provide medical care , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only a vag@@ ue bag description is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall , dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asks witnesses and clu@@ ders to call themselves under the telephone number , 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of Fel@@ ig@@ ausen , and is investing approximately 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Master Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of Fel@@ stan@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ breaks is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the grand@@ stand met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completes their specialist training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and wants to get into practice last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the Mu@@ eller mil@@ ked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an advantage , he also seems to be his own boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller also grew up in Hanover , following his medical studies in Hannover , as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as a senior consultant in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in the D@@ RK @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ aus works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ship ) special@@ ises in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house @-@ doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations , long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and we need a speaker room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 50,000 euros will be given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphasizes Ernst Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ig@@ ausen each quarter , in the northern German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ breaks in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who visits Mul@@ ler &apos;s spokesperson , also continues to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ breaks sm@@ iled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little sad@@ ness , she felt already after the long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and won &apos;t see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pressed against gardening , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also crossed at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , the controls at the Hungarian border remain er@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum claim can &quot; of course &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , neither over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia was@@ hes &apos; corridor &apos; - Slovenia denied
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not look like this in Lai@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia rather wants to intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia , however , was already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians are not aiming to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police was able to pick it up in the near ma@@ ize fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has since been constantly taking police vehicles with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it deals primarily with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country faces roughly 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it is to encourage people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither we can do that , nor do we want to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day another bus would be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants had travelled the whole night from the roughly 500 kilometres distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , through Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the predicted shifting of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat further west route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out rigorous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently posted a good report to the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the reports of the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers advice migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private hung@@ arian aid workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes have been drawn up by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are still no cleared mines for 20 years after the end of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard of a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been accused of having gained insight into un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trials against 32 other accused , in this case , lasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators should have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lot of bustle around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do their concerns , partly quick steps , partly comfortable to stroll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keeping urban railways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ sing , spra@@ w@@ ling life with glorious autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large panels each with the title &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce atten@@ tively made aware of its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the city and people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , like the volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously to the chal@@ k and affir@@ m the sentence &quot; my life happened , &quot; others can go short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , small discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that for me the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical tro@@ oper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly at the tables is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the fact that people open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one assessment that divi@@ des Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mourning counsel@@ or is one of the honorary contribut@@ ors of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking fame by the call of honour , she reported immediately and was part of the founding in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the concerned and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can do well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of health funds and donations made by relatives and associations allows the training , further training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every two years , training for new employees is offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body@@ guard service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. agreed to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ , analysts expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite higher price increases , the lower prospect seems to be 4.@@ 9 percent and be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for heavy and large packages which will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase over the previous year because of cost cutting , higher earnings and because of growth in online retail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company takes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later as the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of the analysts , poll@@ ed by Z@@ ack , expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in its unit express shipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at their most awaited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve spending two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ oming over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : to keep US employment and prices stable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented drop in short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives timi@@ dly reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is unsure of itself the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rate of interest this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising a further increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argued that an interest rate would ease the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed looked at as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with the D@@ ow being now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when interest should be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that she will be waiting at least one month to get a grip on the effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; her monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond W@@ VA re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ ner , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets out for a interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ one these cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S P@@ osen , former member of the committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngest turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest because markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should hurry ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
Y@@ e@@ zi@@ e@@ own - Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is even a car department , if you need engine oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the store is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ ark@@ √º@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s , and has various pick @-@ up options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; products are cheap , and a number of them are sold in large quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat the@@ ke is extensive , as well as fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the counter will clean and cle@@ ave the fish and even fry them on request for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good part of the store is the massive freezer section . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole duck , fish , beef stock , fish balls , fish balls , commercially prepared food and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the Cas@@ hier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Help for Refu@@ ge@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are coming to Germany , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with her 74 L@@ ences , she still teaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is quite different than at a proper school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande encourages healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ sm@@ s Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning for long @-@ awaited gymnas@@ tics construction on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is taking step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated construction contract has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the committee had previously approved an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ con@@ vol@@ uted first and roof shelter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning stage is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; in doing so , we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; says mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was about the pitch that was prescribed for energy reasons - different from the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in relation to roof@@ ing does not allow &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ land sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the district office for review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees , move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision about this is the Supervisory Board , and it meets on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the plans be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au , together with Fischer and the other existing ward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff were informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Head of Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case means an &quot; upgrade &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the federal government , will now be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; as I continued with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference psychiat@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer of the quasi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , which was received positively and comprehen@@ si@@ bly by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer works for over 30 years as a chief physician , did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closing in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) , at the Berg@@ ischen HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is none . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the com@@ ers in the Bh@@ c beat a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ ger with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon , two tractor drivers have been seriously wounded by shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the removal on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Wit@@ tenberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a firing ceremony , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ old , who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted who killed youths and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a crime , a 20 @-@ year old who was arrested on Tuesday evening was also considered as an investig@@ ator and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning , after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not come home as agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators hit the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of surveys among friends of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the body was placed in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put an attack on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of fact , the further investigations are to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even more refugees are seeking an affordable stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the Association of Social H@@ ousing Con@@ duct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial lodging shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are then thrown onto the housing market , and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers live in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany shoots an increase in housing defic@@ its , which is increasing from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently there were some 77@@ ,000 living units in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , many people working in large cities also lived in WG @-@ rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the mira@@ ges in the apartment market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has decreased again for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , new incentives should again stimulate social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the property tax is wai@@ ved and the basic income tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank , Kf@@ W , is already well received in cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros were already available on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free ra@@ iling : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no getting through to Hungary , because more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb is announ@@ cing to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north , without hur@@ dles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the route is nevertheless dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with Slov@@ ene Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day before , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically eliminating ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , most of these media reports come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both by bus and taxis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot over the green border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees are not encounter@@ ing barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the border crossing poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , mine clearance is to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border , however , barely more refugees come to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people challenged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border zone as an off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed Hungarian border town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned threatened prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected the garbage , which tens of thousands of people left the streets in the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barriers were disman@@ tled , and one of the recording camps was rebuilt at the border location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to sell himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the country has reinforced its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mayor drove out &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the elevator , when there were ten people standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany , on Sunday , had unexpectedly set the railway traffic with Austria , was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew up the stu@@ ff@@ les with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had the un@@ hoped @-@ out guests only once , with snacks and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the same , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man couldn &apos;t afford to pay a generous donation , 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very pleased with us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the train passengers had switched to a regional train in direction to Passa@@ u , after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional train , however , was placed in front of the W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high on the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ aly organized a two @-@ bridge run , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n has now sent tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially represented the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry will find that the &quot; landed country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter in order to produce decent conditions for people seeking refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad on the look@@ out for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed districts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the provision of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad is used to , that his word has weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers , to place districts for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the first acceptance centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without big fuss , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad comp@@ utes a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ nal year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 of them will provide the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the state capitals , he has already held talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , to create districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations on the ORF action &quot; Help , as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , private persons can offer accommodation un@@ complicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that j@@ amm@@ ers must respect certain height of the towel rack or the size of the sky@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad with his experience , as opposed to the Ministry of the Interior , establishes Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , who doesn &apos;t say the un@@ truth without further notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the republic any cost , as they stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , their own quest for accommodation has not been successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are obviously problems with the approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criticism of the city chief on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other districts must also contribute here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday announced further proceedings in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me , that the German borders will not be sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is recru@@ ited , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can imagine investing in New Adverti@@ se in Star@@ tup companies , and later acquire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ‚Ç¨ 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T to the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Jutta specializes in getting a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni was forced to post@@ p@@ one this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : finally , it has gained momentum in the form of another business unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater space of Linz who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her fashion @-@ interest has put her mother in the cra@@ dle , her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of all , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into a rap@@ ture , the expert cannot answer with the latest security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe , it &apos;s because a nice bag does every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a town , known as An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the US president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ up@@ sets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he expresses himself alien@@ ated , journalists are concerned , or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency stir@@ s up the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker finds a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf , along the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people in the 1,@@ 200 @-@ inhabitants place is related to him over ump@@ ty corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del directed a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , to which besides Tr@@ ump is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not bring it to the king of hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mouth , says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dently , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the An@@ ders , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ump @-@ up success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the grandfather im@@ migr@@ ated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold graves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland long ago failed at the Bavarian state , at which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Sur@@ vi@@ val History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jump be the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendants , this is in contrast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA , claiming the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Polish , this is not so pleasant , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ son was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so tall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pension owner Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sag@@ as at the time of his grandfather had been like him , he would have never been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 children , and also in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the village of 1800 inhabitants received the award for soft tourism in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the lead of the liber@@ als , but there has been no great changes in Today &apos;s Reviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was hiding in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the stand seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , because the Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators with the five major cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Today has closed the gap to sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August Today , Today average reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 proceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September the Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ √É ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently injured father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL &quot; Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) is the new qui@@ z show , facilit@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe on average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour posted 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally released as &apos; Sun@@ rise dominated , while Today looks &apos; local &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently have unknow@@ ingly obvious who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one , who received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows a day before coming from three two , you may accidentally notice who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the fin@@ als on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If you are not , who should have W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt they were quite compatible and I &apos;ve thought this throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked what wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , in ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally released , as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost a b@@ m as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to get a punch @-@ return , and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a reinforced Hay@@ ne publicly , in his press conference after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ in at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota vi@@ car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ d@@ n and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky and Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man was arrested on a Siber@@ ian tur@@ f by force of arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was condemned to confis@@ cate his oil company and cut his democratic efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Chamber , if there were not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , Friday , Friday in the Unter@@ fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , totally different main topics were planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free UK Meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will transfer the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters away as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for more personnel to the administration courts , who are responsible for asylum suits : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we needed uniform standards of federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have to become more responsive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional policy in big wall@@ stadt should not fall below the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long time favourite is on the agenda : the policy of education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; Mittel@@ stufe C1 &quot; which will be tested for three to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the gym@@ na@@ es that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free travel to G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortress Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed trend @-@ free and nervous trade history with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon , a fair pr@@ el@@ ude led to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which finally promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X average value won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the lending index of the euro@@ zone , decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid profits , too , recorded commercial places in London and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently listed some 1 percent in the Plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the stock markets expect the markets to be replaced by the end of the interest rate in the US , and also to the large fall on the term exchanges this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pressed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , leaving the shares left deep in E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies might lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Da@@ x peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US feeder magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , investors are giving too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were again placed than in the same period of the previous year as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent , respectively 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 1.@@ 26 percent , Volkswagen benefits fell by 1.@@ 26 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the German pension market , the return on listed national securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points , the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , the price of the Euro sank to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ ic , senior official officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station and some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr D@@ hak@@ ic said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high rate of death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us , who want their own country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a building site planned in the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plot at the Em@@ de youth centre , Old Post , is to be built again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the city is preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to mix trade , commerce and housing - but there is no concrete proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a land of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wait for appropriate offers , that is , the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what investor demand is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts had yet been signed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is on the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner Gro√üe Stra√üe , already bought a few months ago and let the buildings rip it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday resort on the little sea near Em@@ den take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some applicants are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure agent
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new holiday resort on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the City Development Committee at the Em@@ press Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the critics and the F@@ DP Group , which submitted to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach from the system @-@ building management went into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and over 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the project involving roughly ten to twelve million euros has been in discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent reactions among the owners of the sea , which had come to the meeting , produced the images and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Marine Ow@@ ner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; there must be whole bos@@ ses to be settled , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this was still lacking , construction plans were still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ations Campa@@ ign to gather 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund@@ raising campaign to help thousands of refugees un@@ roll by the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google associate who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railroad and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : international Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million , to a value of 5.5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria that has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many flee from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for slightly overweight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article about the new study at J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity has proved efficient in type 2 diabetes treatment , but most of the studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c hose formation - for people who were slightly overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes &apos;s disease has been completely dissolved and 28 % partially dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared with diabetes , the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group was completely dis@@ solving by only one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the medical therapy group remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also tolerated average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and achieved greater revers@@ als in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have permanently connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ r√º@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a subject that is being increasingly noticed in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we &apos;re not so &quot; from Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r√º@@ ck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama thank@@ ed Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing will be less@@ ened in its countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US dragged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase in suspension of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ isons control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which strongly swal@@ lows down alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children were drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing among the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive to children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation in particular for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison@@ ous emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry and disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice above the threshold that is legally dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them outside Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors over@@ took them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had turned his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants , and ban@@ ished them from their room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the ser@@ ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a collision at the cross @-@ bridge between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ dem , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist has been slightly hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year old truck driver drove on the cross bar towards the industrial area , and became too late that two vehicle drivers had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage to the vehicles involved in the accident was about 10 000 euros , the police reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer pass@@ able , and had to be tow@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
g@@ ossi@@ p Kitchen : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Aff@@ air
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths shut down the talk of dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will do that again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA due to alle@@ gations of N@@ eil@@ son and war@@ bur@@ ton being cau@@ tious in January re @-@ commitments that could destroy the unit of the squ@@ ad
D@@ ons raise leadership over Celtic to five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about dis@@ cord
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control because they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Nieder@@ l√§nder - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers aren &apos;t there .
people here are not just talking about the R@@ angers &apos; return .
you &apos;re talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that is what interests them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian leader s@@ wore to turn things upside down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat of Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands clearly at the top of the table with five points lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this , but we have to continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need to really support Celtic support , because that makes the players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , together , it is so important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing New Rel@@ eases and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players who come in summer , have this Pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference note
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a nasty K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years , and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defence was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um that was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have questioned integrity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ po@@ ises
the improved Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast in March 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the St√ºr@@ mer , &quot; It is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast , if not for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice supervisory board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still trust in the management team to turn things upside down , but confess that the decline has to end on the playing field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen was forced to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to win a seventh consecutive league victory thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in po@@ k@@ ums or li@@ lies that have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom overall increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 % U@@ K@@ s , as the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) showed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ t commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago , that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as security guards could not bring peace , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , a respir@@ ation alcohol test was 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and was first in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why I am Wit@@ ness of an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be chosen , will observe it emotion@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed for me to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , on Twitter , accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present , to write there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ , a re@@ porter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please check the Pod@@ casts series that I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ aries of the deed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that there is a strong probability , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective , I will see him dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porters , which you can turn to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after damp police chase , he persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he over@@ talked the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called to a domestic peac@@ ekeeping incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not very enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins @-@ bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to end racing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he points to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment - the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ til dress at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , it went on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tonight , I will go home tonight and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to walk around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , I must think about what I &apos;m doing with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had reported the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to pick up his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man I &apos;m asked to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they obviously believe , that I am a dec@@ eiver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed to believe me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should this bring me to the conclusion , that it will be personal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in cow@@ ard@@ ly behavi@@ ours and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe people out there , that I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting ob@@ session , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ failing master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race Sunday treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse &apos;s cloth@@ s , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had , however , on the race day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crew arrested after the driver &apos;s flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a crash with a bi@@ cycli@@ st and following driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycli@@ st was delivered with serious injuries by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is expected to be charged for driver &apos;s flight and assistance , and for other traffic off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram stays in the hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals for claims of ring fight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has designated a cri@@ tique of Tac@@ onic &apos;s Tac@@ kling as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting , &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; ring @-@ fights &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a slight remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team , saying they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bell@@ amy , he added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team agree that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s appearing again and again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ ling , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us the turn of the trend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is funny , as it always appears at this time of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he would take care of a shooting trick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play them like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger faith , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are breaks , and no points any tension ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ security deposit after drug delivery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could possibly face life imprisonment for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later in the Cafe Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a possibly life imprisonment for attempting to possess a commercial set of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to own the entire amount and that he could have been a harmless reason in the caf√© . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of floo@@ ding at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ ghty explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit under the conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport to be reported daily by the police and detained at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : the driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of a permanent construction site , two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noted it too late , and in vain tried to turn to the left , as the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing travel@@ er torn apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked over six hours , until 2 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept and was logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of incomplete pictures of children sent to him by another user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing , and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it , found the be@@ wil@@ dered messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches , using concepts for the search for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it since it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did so , to l@@ ure it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone , and confronted the accused with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , having dismissed inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year and not appeared before court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the sentence .
tu@@ g@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people , from fear of discovery and arrest , increased the number of people in smaller cross @-@ border cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the river boundary river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the coastal communities of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had access to the German side by foot , through bridges and a traffic jam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they are sent to reception by Federal Police , and forwarded to the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , there were clearly more refugees arriving at Munich &apos;s main station on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8 : 00 , said one speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a low pressure region on Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country currently , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , it is possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) , alone in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in the autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel launches its entry below the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra will cost at least 16 9@@ 90 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine , with a capacity of 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is now only five @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what &apos;s next , next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he enters the trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan in@@ lay wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adapts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe , in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n design laid hands on the front panel : here the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex in@@ mate of the prison prison Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , an ex in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a prison facility in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with some five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot after his lawyer &apos;s statements , had been moved into a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his term of responsibility for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and re@@ mitted the case to re@@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
the Court of Appe@@ als decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation have been decisive for compensation , it was said to be a compensation claim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , they talked to a prisoner of in@@ mates because he was locked up in a cell naked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a decision from 2011 , human dignity is also the multiple allocation of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed a decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , such as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours more aggres@@ siv@@ ity , even massac@@ res must have been due to the tense situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s forecasts , around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , the following overview is given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is dramatic above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price are falling and refugees are also applying for these particularly cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments would have to be developed annually and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in agreement , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry farmers in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them start their career , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is vital if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the throne , there has been a political shift in Germany : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a job ban for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as was the residence obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , a majority of the points of view have prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , there is still no adequate offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , studies show that work@@ stations are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the building up of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to labor integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ ro@@ uted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to convince the family , however , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management hand@@ outs are distributed in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students without a knowledge of German are prepared for classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or individuals who studied - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a recreation or D@@ ul@@ ing do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter generally do not get a ban , since they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this gap must be closed , and ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately , the students should receive B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually give the same rights to Islam as it has the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches law will continue to develop into a new state religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also belong to duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to heed religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany immediately began their right to linger here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , integration will be much more than today an issue of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency since a decade , and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U hom@@ icide unit showed , systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention Germany have to become reality in the coming years - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees so far , says Medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests to susp@@ end health cards at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , services could be calculated with the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to iron so many people with the limited performance catalogue to see the asylum application law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse for their illnesses than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , they demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many refugees , however , would have been helped with more general emergency ambul@@ ances in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugees , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and for the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partly remaining disease pictures German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take the exam again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill , according to estimates made by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flas@@ hes of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong trem@@ bling and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , however , only four per cent of the mentally ill patients receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can apply for a psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst has taken hold of the tradition of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to day@@ dream in the man@@ ege on the brick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the gift to fan@@ atics is the family in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst part of his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program of the Cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban Duo wants to pick up the Cuban du@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light@@ ness and agi@@ lity - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ larvae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and agi@@ lity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
balance the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others , and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , we are not well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy every string unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the highest commandment is good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is very proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals have lived in a nest for eight years , and nothing happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there is something for every visitor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from September 17 to 20 , every day at 5 : 00 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and HP announced in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business &quot; said Whit@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shares a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electrical systems and the Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere won &apos;t miss at least the next four matches for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big dis@@ grace on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old swing back during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of violation does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bone , which did not heal well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in touch with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries that he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it develops , too , an unpleasant pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd &apos;s study lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als , 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight game @-@ times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced most of the vulner@@ ability days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a temporary period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arsen@@ al will start its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo , Zagreb , before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation inside the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta might start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has withdrawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco , and remains from the far @-@ away hope to lead the club to his first European Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out with arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high che@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men from 20 to 45 in the UK , and there are three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an effort to address the problem the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ects ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture of men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course , one has to have friends for a friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even though isolated in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beauty at Friends was , that this focus was placed on the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments while sitting in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely get back to explore their feelings completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone counsel@@ ing employee told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk has clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying , &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration to celebrate the day totally re@@ designed backdrop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria , to help PS@@ G to crush the Malm@@ √∂ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani on his way to Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PS@@ G , di Maria is helping to drop by Malm@@ √∂ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ at the Prin@@ zen@@ parquet Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani got a head bal@@ er at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while they got the points it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not yet have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team that held a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own spot against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stopped in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he indicated why when he joined Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he passed away nicely to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off , hit the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ illar in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G gave himself up sometimes , with some mis@@ hes and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half alone after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c which was turned by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . therefore , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an had its sixth win , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz &apos;s final result before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognised a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach from Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through share sales
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core which is based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its huge student education plan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core business registered in London said in an explanation that it has sold new shares valued at about 1.6 billion pounds , in order to pay its own debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the output of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share jumped by 2.6 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its 30 billion $ debt , announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1.3 billion shares of up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees come to Weimar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ oultry come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the White House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosting X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have held bilateral discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i add the possibility to construc@@ tively address areas of differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , first announced in February , will probably meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before heading to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4@@ 40 @-@ PS sports cars can be rented and driven to S@@ cra@@ p
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfill a dream , and gave himself a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the wet highway , the evil awakening came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can meet the dream and rent a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 4@@ 40 hp and drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so did this , also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district of Got@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , fell on wet driving and drove to the guard rail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports car suffered total harm , no one was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material damage is estimated to be 40,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented her from moving to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league champion , two times champion league , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa would like to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we do nothing , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the registered , also the Bayern Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardian was the reason X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and today , the decisive man is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the squ@@ ad without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns acted in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , turned the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King class triumph at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protag@@ onist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments by the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian were captiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said initially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o , the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the film directing rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 points since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time , at the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged authorities and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent times , the leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l , who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crow@@ s first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contest show , which had just completed its 7th season , never experienced an competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope was part of the climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the profit of the big price of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved or had more than 10,000 dollars , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine , how this is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten did not get any prize money at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes the life , he receives the great grat@@ efulness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father @-@ in @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Isaac felt exactly the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was renewed for an eighth season , and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers slide past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once upon a time , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers were reduced to their roll as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ wins offered a chance to climb up in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros , for the second American League game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers &quot; Brad &apos;s Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two pati@@ os , then once in sixth and then again in ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ bars every game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung it well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three rounds at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed blade Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run d@@ enture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen delivered the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ff suggested a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit added a Garden Run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , S@@ ano out of three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit benefited from the opening of the game of an even more mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list before the game had been missing more than a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier when I was letting go and feel that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the lead in the first place of the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ky gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z , Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z brought a single &quot; up the middle &quot; to the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers came in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right handed by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three rounds with six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the wor@@ shipping shoulders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August because of a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is crossed off the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been missing since August 20 , because of a distortion in the right hip joint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 ; 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees expected to go underground in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who were there should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the town Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 people to be refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be further distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen according to the Belgian pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective abor@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military involvement in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced inspections to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not call them concrete figures , and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann proposed a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , Germany had begun with temporary border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting for a binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee tragedy in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery of Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people would need protection , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a pencil @-@ view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the round , this view was strongly divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on the night to Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to cross the border with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from seeking ev@@ asive maneu@@ vering over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first ar@@ rests of people , who had cut the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , there were thousands of immigrants coming to Greece on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ice cap of Saturn , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ ells a global ocean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the moon is easily tra@@ m@@ pled on its orbit around the ring planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this movement is only small , but still too big for a permanent heavenly body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; technical sheet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thereby feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ama , missing in 1860 , Munich several weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 @-@ old , Munich , must abst@@ ain from an offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a flaw@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Six@@ ties , however , presented a defensive role as a training guest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium , and earlier it was under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ √§ger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , in a violent collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained un@@ wei@@ ghted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no fruit diet - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : there are B vitamins in them as well as vitamins E and C. In particular man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruit thus supports the vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so , even green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they taste pure , or in sweet foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man@@ go , however , gives a special touch to hearty dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US package service U@@ PS will again provide up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has already begun with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drivers are mainly looking for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already last year , U@@ PS increased its staff for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had made the parcel services resin criticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first f@@ low@@ out tower and then striking cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the north side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , how Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland distributed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and Thursday night , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows the fo@@ eh@@ n through the fo@@ eh@@ ere valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after flying on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful Sou@@ thwest current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the side of the Alps , the F@@ √∂hn winds through the valleys in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows up to Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with more than 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can penetrate up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ als of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , the F@@ √∂hn winds its summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , South of the Alps need to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has already fallen in the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ √∂hn winds out , and in a row a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the cold front , the wind starts to fres@@ hen up to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures drop considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the weekend it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the park is right in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live only in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 , a few months in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , he felt the city as a rotten sin @-@ bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to historians , his negative impressions might have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his thes@@ es on Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel , Luther had initiated the division of the Western Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns , Jesus is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ an has written the introduction and has updated Bible texts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , was the Word ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Testament , which is now published with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting cycles are devoted to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag , with its emphasis on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ an , who is based on painting with the respective Bible verses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical texts selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current connections to the present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embedded in the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , emotions were the cause of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Sovereign Order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on that , so that I might also be able to wear the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is that art will be more important in quick@@ y time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artists have a different pleasure and pleasure , to show things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures always have something mysterious , and are not decorative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alto wants viewers to &quot; fall up &quot; into the images , let them discover , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ pl@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation . &quot; I like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he can understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but chosen the most important , mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the origin@@ als - Paper and canvas paintings - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation on November 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway is approaching
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place found , companies ordered , ground guard mod@@ eled for a round course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail it was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ink@@ age , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , the first joint organizer Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to inform the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; further memorial break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the sit@@ ing situation in Germany , and ass@@ ures its help in dealing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mr@@ s √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer can , and may , help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive turn@@ out must , however , place the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiative by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , some Bundes@@ liga @-@ lists support this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they will support the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football allies , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the European Championship round on Hungary on Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney s@@ bach designated the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 license clubs in their locations had started their own projects , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as great is , that small and smallest clubs are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : the Chief Operating Officer loses an eye in case of an accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye to several reports by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US , he dropped onto a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ shed , impot@@ ent , then dragged out onto the road - he told us this last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting , and &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again when you fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he comes to the night race in Singapore on the weekend as little as a spare runner for the two Stam@@ mer@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar , one of the Rock@@ ef@@ eller in the gate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have been defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga , in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t fall back on him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach leaves : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem from the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he announced a change on the door@@ way position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ based Roman brus@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether Wei@@ den@@ si@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the forward statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B must be the goal in the Europa League , says Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehensible : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological leader in the transformation of the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt said in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A , a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , said Mr. Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which will also come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany wants to use an international level to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has previously only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automated driving , the car also takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which record the environment and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are to be expected only far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors of the study will value the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , from 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday stipul@@ ates that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway , this could be 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current status in the title fight of September 25 to October 4 , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ D√ºsseldorf wants to beat only in the single . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 , 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf , during the European Championship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing appointment in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became European Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United , bred a heavy injury on the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender has been hit by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 20 , the first diagnosis pointed to a sl@@ ump in sl@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights : mannequins , which look human@@ ely human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and with the fact that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal , Canada and Montreal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly retro@@ spective work of the man , who wrote fashion history without ever completing his training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work , for which a lot of effort was practi@@ sed : to promote the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the manufacturer Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have had 14 tons of material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , a special treat was still present : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Our Lady .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stands for the first , agile fashion attempts of the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , he taught the designing of fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ste@@ els fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first show , he didn &apos;t have to pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener top as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make a meter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in a large amount for customers , for example , they worked on blankets and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early stages of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bul@@ ls , is an increasing application potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already do half of all jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , Sp@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association of P@@ lau@@ en and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is almost no more private specialist shops , as well as the wholesale trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , our products hardly reach the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , exports are weaker , up to date to Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , enough reasons for new ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have led a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly modified to hold a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some spots , the machine embroi@@ der small balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gold sil@@ vers@@ mith Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took his inspiration from this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland , mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to see a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family , in times of the global economic crisis in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide to the outside in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , recovery of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after and after , the system is tested and improved by test programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it assign@@ s a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , the statement said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will enable border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , other areas for private investments are opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and provide better services for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders , such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , participated as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus en@@ vision consumers a significantly higher dose of neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ lation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a &apos; EU working paper &apos; , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force in pregnant women and infants , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish should be raised from one milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller fish , such as car@@ p , are generally so low that they already comply with the planned limits already today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in small fish is therefore a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal for humans , which is heavily concentrated in predat@@ or fish through the food chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on its homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , mercury enters the environment through coal combustion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequent reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
