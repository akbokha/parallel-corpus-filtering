Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel , bringing Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal made by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the Congress of the Republi@@ cans before the Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , he was admitted to having shot his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was glued to a white block : &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that lamb , who was enrolled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , was already shot and killed at the door to his office according to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ Emplo@@ ye@@ es have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : he took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students said , that they were happy about their teaching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said that he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee an automatic path to an adjustment as Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs trail later when he went back into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the spring , he completed his doc@@ torate in education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through joint friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were , obviously , some time together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and A@@ big@@ ail met both in a summer fair three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played together the one or other gig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were in the open , and we were jo@@ king together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ enk@@ wache , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected to reflect that Lamb made the emergency call after having shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call was calling Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there was no indication that the two had ever married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ ys R Us tells you that there will not be so many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees will rise from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip retailers with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox sne@@ aks over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and I gradually realized that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simulated gin and an arm length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that his response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the protests in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which in order to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey results that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from upper ranks in surveys down , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten , say they have a negative opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these figures are in early states , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with jump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when J@@ eb Bush was the candidate of the establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of Republi@@ cans , Tr@@ ump &apos;s temper@@ ament does not look as a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his duties , and almost six of 10 Independent Sa@@ ys that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they expose their guar@@ dians , republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten last week after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , when four of the ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , GO@@ P voters didn &apos;t have the clear@@ est crystal ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters will look at the campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , tr@@ ump beats almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts suggest that the frag@@ mented field probably contributes to tr@@ ump leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , ump the majority support is harvested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina he scored 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points before J@@ eb Bush 19 points before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only candidate , who beats him ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters , who support Tr@@ ump , say they have won their votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with jump on the topic of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will be decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with jump on immigration issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to do too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support from republi@@ can voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of ten Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ Monday survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re also mad at Washington , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago showed that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans at the Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the Hob@@ by@@ en@@ weg , you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea resort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , one square meter of a cage house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited by nature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meaning the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , which particular locations cost one square meter most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price comes from the same as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate service provider , Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ el , published a ranking of the most exclusive German home sites - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros -- per square meter , well marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way : Munich , for example , is not at the forefront here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double Tor@@ shake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way for FC Bayern to make the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus , then it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave a dream start to FC Bayern , which took part in the Milan Mission Milan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 28th hits in the Champions League to Bavaria leadership , M√ºller received good assistance from Olympic champion go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who passed a shot of the Grand Master as a f@@ lange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a focused and dedicated performance , without glit@@ tering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but in their offensive efforts they often go to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often triggered by a game shift on left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M√ºller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ eck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , as the Olympic champion of Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct debit , the keeper of Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Bav@@ arians stri@@ pped their usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to set lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the door@@ way of Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when he defle@@ cted a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from this is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G√∂t@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear about 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller added one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of partially mixed Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good news : when doing so , the risk decreases quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smoking smokers , smokers were the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists observed more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tooth loss is the main cause of tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is due to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y infections in smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , and the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the British University Birmingham explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , said Dr. H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , leads to good dental health up to a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of lack of tooth@@ lessness distributed the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter remains of late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , archaeological finds have been found on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum has always been added as a specialist for archae@@ ology care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found their place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the remains of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman from freight train captured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman died in the accident at the railway station in Gei@@ ss@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was seized by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the acquisition of the train , it has carried serious injuries to the federal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was treated with emergency medical care on site , and brought to a hospital by rescue workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal Equ@@ al crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence to the moder@@ ating officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident might have been observed by witnesses , or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; residents or pedestri@@ ans of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , tiled floor , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the cause of the accident can be given under the telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 , or any other police station under the telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to strengthen the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private mediation mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ili@@ a Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to develop with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the United States will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to objec@@ tively revolt against primitive elements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the proceedings took place among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , and there was no claim against their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months discussions have become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness are not familiar , commented Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court according to their own specifications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly of large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , taking into account the tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act accepted the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was critic@@ ised above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the reform of major points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , took into account in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of this , the business association Business Europe warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy through too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when talks about TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this deadline is no longer available .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole audience , about 40 persons , is nearly attended by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us about various places that he always records on the map , revealing his meti@@ culous and delicate arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be wonderfully creative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties but can drift into great opul@@ ent colours at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it creates rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a das@@ hed line : each of the 50 US states should be sung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans has already appeared and has a positive expectation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is released in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album entered the ameri@@ can bil@@ l@@ board charts , and no annual list of influential music media is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after exceedingly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth decent studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from the smaller clubs , stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens become much more mature back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; sla@@ b in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with suspen@@ se at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to announce his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde , and for the first time he will invest with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some meetings , to leave her colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the Labour Chair &apos;s decision on Tuesday , during the singing of the national an@@ them , has provoked silence , provo@@ king criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ le @-@ Stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour President to sing the national an@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ack@@ able within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that the Labour amendments set out to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Working and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 ¬£ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has &quot; crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s cargo unit is confronted with &quot; pun@@ ish@@ ness , &quot; and that he has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kasper@@ l theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; shot in Job@@ ab &quot; : homeless young people trained to photographers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the centre of Johannes@@ burg is a very hard spot , if one is homeless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a group of former street children found a way to learn a skill , and to earn a living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Po@@ und rises by accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and advanced assessment of the time of an interest rate increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and assemble brands like Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - have reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares in the Mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment for the rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports insurance company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could meet J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ eber building : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hung up in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my wi@@ ki would have to sit in the high school in the tenth grade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling her dream . &quot;

who &apos;s it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber herself does not .
that has already taken care of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he earned three million dollars for advertisement in the Super@@ US advertising break , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with every doll , which looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also assists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have exploited more than 100 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some say that the hyp@@ e g@@ inge is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others emphas@@ ise that Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber herself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he does so .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the shop has a barbecue , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the idea has been registered by the Lebanese patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility patent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much meat and how many potatoes of the sk@@ ew@@ er contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with its customers , the culinary understanding is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ cash starts Con@@ soli@@ dation Campa@@ ign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor stand campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , brands like ice makers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops , and shop owners selling dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor strategy day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will grab about five percent of the market in these two countries after opening his first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers &apos; sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley said that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million per year and metal 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that in next year Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in the food and food business and the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around ‚Ç¨ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market share in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business grew by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2017 , reducing the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retailers , which accounts for about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers since 2012 , is reflected in sales and margins at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , res@@ ists and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to boost sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an are growing , hoping that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserved praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious engagement with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp was scre@@ ed by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was stri@@ pped in the fight , He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat from fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gi@@ os on Friday , and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Cy@@ rene &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think that Nick has made very quick progress on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public and deserves all the criticism he receives , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the parties trying to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got rising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian stand@@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them declined from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not a col@@ lateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refuge in the over@@ grown Italy and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to handle the crisis , so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were deployed in the race , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point for the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament still has to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter into Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( up 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eled for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders back only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , however , has a major advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six percent would not support it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are most enthusiastic about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter , it would support them enthusi@@ astically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate is the most common answer that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned , with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and elec@@ bility is quoted as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked by the election , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Bi@@ den decided not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead against S@@ anders increases from 20 points in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that considers it as &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the three candidates Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den concep@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not influenced overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of them saying that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded as sincere and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent consider it to be honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 per cent of the eligible voters do not hold them to an honest , trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters are not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good scores on leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off the best with hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for sample sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the two candidates , half of the support for voters in the new survey has now been eliminated , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters continue to support large numbers nationwide . the support grows from 23 % in the recent C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month and 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same period , Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received with demographic groups , sur@@ passing Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is at the lowest , from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son climbs in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the jump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed a jump in front of Car@@ son , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising over the past week , Tr@@ ump found some side ads for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a maximum of 17 degrees , a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week shares the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes to up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood stressed with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and supposedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the welfare of the br@@ other@@ hood about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated injuries to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies to the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e suggested an indictment concerning Mor@@ des third degree , for the first five members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization officially or in@@ official - we will also account for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will happen , when the F@@ ed increases interest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest is coming , and the house will be wan@@ ing , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was exagger@@ ated because of a rate rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still at a low level to fear the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a look at historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen by the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened following interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is usually upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares would appear in the increase cycle later , and the return on return begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point , at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 net interest increases have been rated only twice as nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop might be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed &apos;s interest all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only shares a 25 percent chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increase cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists quickly moved to the shadow after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and so far this has been 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of bonds , the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the increase @-@ in @-@ cycle the bond returns immediately dropped , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates leads to the return of yields between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve has increased and volati@@ lity has increased , and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and large part of the company , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debts are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after initial interest rate increases , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , companies are losing the most , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of the pure pool games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains through higher earnings even if experts in different opinion are how quickly this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for its &quot; di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also particip@@ ates at the BBC Music Awards , saying that they only im@@ itate The Br@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the voice of The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private travel@@ er does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also particip@@ ates at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards launched last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed of classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that fell under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insisted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to en@@ close the order of other series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the fees for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internet sales were slow@@ ing down in August , and Black Friday may be responsible for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , online sales increased by using mobile phones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed spending , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began operating with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that is a swing , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black Friday Phen@@ om@@ enon imported from America is quoted as a reason for declining sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , would stop buyers from making purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of ¬£ 5,000 a little more than ¬£ 1 was spent online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the accident of a crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mec@@ ca , the dead bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia depl@@ ores the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane gir@@ ded to Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gri@@ eving filled , largely clothed in white , the route to declare their respect , when the first of the dead stood their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mourning procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mosque and then collapsed on the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 operators who were killed , as a crane rolled by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual p@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ lers will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane should not have stopped when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab version of the decree published by the government Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news agency in English did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was forbidden abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the great mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the breakdown of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s great mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late Al Qaeda leader , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a retired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other injuries receive half of this amount , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British are increasingly occupied by arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of skilled workers in Eastern Europe has increased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at craftsmen , are opened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points of sale nationwide
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British are increasingly occupied by craftsmen to conduct home@@ work in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ √©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , has now out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , set up to professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; There are still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of the five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also rev@@ amped their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and C@@ FO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the Group had deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them was also charged with abuse of power , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants emerged in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants had money from club accounts in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he covers the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial years , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact divided the chairman of the Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence assumed that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen at no time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials were only charged with expense compensation and the sports club for whom they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to lay our life insurance as security at the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the payment of reimbur@@ sement expenses was retro@@ spec@@ tively decided in the case of appropriate financial success until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the expense compensation was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 when an asset had been on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Pau@@ wel@@ - and not detail @-@ deduc@@ tions appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and portfolios managed the two accused together , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of financial support ; it is important that the freedom of debt has been important , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 , against the one official investigation for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were back@@ rests , the def@@ endants declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account went to the name of the second accused , and according to his statement the association was not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know a long answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then finally , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation , since the association had never been damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he merely paid o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he charged 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual expenditure had been much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exact documents for the early years were not indic@@ ative of the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were no longer kept , after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second accused , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the exercises were made in cash , and he said in his statement that he had to drive to the bank from his place of residence on the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main trial will continue on September 23 , with the interro@@ gation of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard offers more than 30,000 jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the pay@@ roll that has been running for three years , the Computer terri@@ ese will be able to build more jobs at the company &apos;s split@@ ting up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not have an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , costs in the amount of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) were saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share gave 2.3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a split@@ ting up and massive positions , HP responds to changes in the sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded very late , that customers can increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the breakdown of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tili@@ ties in Iraq would predominantly be re@@ jec@@ ting : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 percent would be eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers of the V@@ DA car association count as two years ago , with approximately 900 000 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ ted on Serbian @-@ Hungarian borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke T@@ r√§n@@ eng@@ as and water@@ works against several hundred displaced refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence erup@@ tion at the border control point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it , a police line was formed and a water cann@@ on was standing behind the polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , the officials began to use mint spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereafter , the police used tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees sag@@ ged in themselves , and suffered under difficulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police have suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade interest has been raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed was going to do this now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historic event , because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest has put interest on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Associ@@ ate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook to global proportions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death cont@@ ests at Delta State University left ap@@ ology
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he later shot his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; he could do it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , Professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said he shot someone , and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call center , that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; There is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later at that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb received a doc@@ torate in the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his way of life on the university &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this , for sure , calls for its toll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa construc@@ ts the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year , with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the globally around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and utili@@ ses eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , there is no longer any management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team led by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the significance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airline operates under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations should be resum@@ ed on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; Cockpit hopes to achieve viable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the drivers , the wings are the &quot; Wings &quot; saving concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that Lufthansa has reloc@@ ated to the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South , &quot; the paintings of Le@@ ena Kr√º@@ ger can be seen in the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White Hall of the House , the Finnish @-@ based Finn@@ in has put together a selection of tit@@ ular works which encourage their viewers to move thou@@ ght@@ fully on the journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play Mon@@ el@@ ang because of double frac@@ ture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this brought the left outer defender to tears and won him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field , and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later , and then underwent surgery in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then played fantastic , and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had been wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am . my way to recovery now begins now . I come back stronger . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad about it , I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado has also been taken to the hospital , after a throw from Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless you are David Cameron , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided the environmental label of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to give to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , returns the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy is hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if this is not suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron partly reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie that is arti@@ ficially arranged and even the air is a commodity . a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the story of the book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said , that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finding Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a revers@@ al victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related message : Adam Ly@@ th comes from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , if he turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.@@ K. coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss commen@@ ded his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t bring so good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first inv@@ aded Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist whom I set up high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this obviously depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to leave mo@@ een beside Cook , providing an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and got four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he immediately made three hundred posts , and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes back to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see its statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England made some smart supplements at the training station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ches of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and a powerful deployment into the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access , if the economy gets into a loud device by 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ challenged new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently dis@@ sec@@ ted on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplomatic friend said recently that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU itself and not always on their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prime minister and finance ministers climb up on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants to look outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to them whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) and Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zzling power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberate on intentionally not helpful notes , all in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is suspected my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1973 referendum with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may be able to remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als most of our large newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , it is better to ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press , too , has never forgiven him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste more for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it out , in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff charge and the wil@@ der realms of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties for all reports on the Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media ; a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambigu@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their current Benn@@ ite siege economy - is not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its ambigu@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not have a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 persons , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose management was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco remedies ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector funding in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , also the tobacco line of p@@ he took part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is marked by the fact that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products by most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were premature to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear alle@@ ging of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ enders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like E@@ ast@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly presented by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as wide support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like E@@ ast@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them into a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its thi@@ an mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the public TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows , how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the instant in which they have high frequencies with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fil@@ th@@ worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , reinfor@@ ces ultras@@ onic waves that penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels , and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and metro trains , which require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the D@@ LR line which transforms into the image of a tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a flock of arms dealers will drive with the D@@ LR ... customers are asked to help stop the ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; which claims that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet is achieved . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists turn to work with activists in protest movements , and realize they have to move out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency who works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic double @-@ minded company advertising , but &quot; by the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job , helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step towards the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors spend fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of what I have learned , can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the arrival in student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you come from where you have Sab@@ bat@@ n , and why you can honestly don &apos;t love or hate Mar@@ mite because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and help others to do the same - place questions , and show interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ is@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also places where people wear themselves and put their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone trying to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in my residence , had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves , and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a flush to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make any noise , people distra@@ ct from sleep or work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my floor asked her neighbors , if it makes them a little qui@@ eter to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ acted to this , with even lou@@ der music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she dropped her own music , shut her door and came to her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future spouse would move into the same residence hall at random ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it would not be fundamentally embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , separate yourself and see them every day and perhaps witness how they bring together all common friends to yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak to your subordin@@ ate a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment you realize that someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never aw@@ aken any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but don &apos;t pack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees - single @-@ educational and low @-@ income
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money , in the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of Eck@@ ental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the ear@@ ring servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build better and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or sports halls has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because people stay here , for a large part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space over the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey house is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is different , if you put people in blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seekers each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much is the cost ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building rights have taken my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still subordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the cities , there is no place for that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asylum seekers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but they were built in luxury homes that hardly could afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the ear@@ ring @-@ servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build , even today , cheap and good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it is about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system , when Apple update is released &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space , but Apple has made it more likely to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may turn on half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton just one motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup also stressed that I had nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 53 points separate the vice @-@ champion in Singapore before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday , defending champion and double champion Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far , and also took the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for days , a Dun@@ st@@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbour island of Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde von Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the winner of the First Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the City of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp , and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the city .
district office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square , Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new agency for Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as nursing insurance or services of nursing and care insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that relatives often are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are endless questions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; department for the elderly and for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offerings from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally complementary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Executive Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders , particularly in demographic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg , in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated itself to the unification of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Social Foundation is making a major contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors are able to live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6@@ pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breeding Bam@@ berg against W√ºrzburg Ki@@ ckers on October 6
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is official : after the renovation work at the Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ sta@@ dion , Bam@@ berg had not yet been established against the third @-@ party W√ºrzburg Ki@@ ckers , the 6th October was fixed as an appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the meeting of the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the semi@@ fin@@ als of the Bavarian football team tot@@ op@@ ok@@ als against the third @-@ party FC W√ºrzburg ki@@ ckers has now been defini@@ tively under@@ mined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is played on Tuesday , October 6 at the 19th o &apos;clock in the Bam@@ berg Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ sta@@ dion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning security , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z H√º@@ mmer who also points to the ticket sales launched now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our team , it is something special to play against a third party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because Fl@@ ut@@ light games have a special charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg moved to 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Region@@ alli@@ gi@@ sts 1st , FC Schwein@@ furt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winner of the competition receives 5,000 euros and quali@@ fies for the first round of the DF@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DF@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 / 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus was shared on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnst@@ l@@ erhaus awards a honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect and worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
parking : Tim Wiese re@@ jects polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese is noticed in Bremen , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once upon a time , Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ h√º@@ ter was engaged in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his own testimony in the past two years , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , he did not acknowledge intellectu@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city center of Bremen , a meadow had just cut off the hair when he saw a parking space guard exhibited a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , meadow stor@@ med from the shop , insul@@ ted the bureaucracy and threw it in front of the feet as the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations that the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the exam , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only then will I decide if meadow is displayed , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man , and struck his face with the fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone frac@@ ture , and bleeding strongly from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as his two friends were ha@@ sten@@ ing and responding to the bat , this first left his sacrifice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to the apartment , and demonstr@@ atively passed over there several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , they checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , there is only a vag@@ ue daily description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second ra@@ cket was about 1,@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ask witnesses and information , to call themselves on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and is investing 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the praxis Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the retirement of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich continues his successor in the coming months with half a position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the grand@@ stand prior years ago met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completes their education training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and wants to enter into practice this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the mil@@ ler couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an advantage , he also seems to be his own boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller grew up there , following his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as a senior consultant in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in the D@@ RK @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a primary doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house @-@ doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations , long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 50,000 euros will be given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Zambia Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen every quarter , in the north German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , he who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s talk also still looks in familiar faces : the seven medical assistants and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long time , she already felt a little sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients quite often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed before gardening , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also crossed on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , the controls on the Hungarian border remain er@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum claim can &quot; of course do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that clear signals need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia was@@ hes &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and may , in certain circumstances , er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see this in Lai@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia is , however , already strongly controlled as the outside limit of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to deny its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian police , however , could attack them in the near ma@@ ize fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continually meets police vehicles with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it deals mainly with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days his country expects about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which have brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was a matter of propos@@ ing people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants had travelled the whole night from the roughly 500 kilometres distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , through Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the predicted shifting of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat more western route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that , in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct rigorous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have consistently made a good report to the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private hung@@ arian aid workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes have been drawn up in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance teams was sent to the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock exchange h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the trials against 32 further accused took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators should have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lot of bustle around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people do their concerns , partly quick steps , partly comfortable to stroll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce atten@@ tively made aware of its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the midst of the city and people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously to chal@@ k up and affir@@ m the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; others can go short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , small discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with death develop themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realise that for me the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim Di@@ ac@@ onic Plant , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tables is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the fact that people open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment that divi@@ des Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral service is one of the honorary contribut@@ ors of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking fame by the call of honour , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the concerned and relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid works well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from a different point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of the health funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training , as well as further training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ de@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every two years , training for new employees is offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the increase in price increases , the lower view amounts to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for heavy and large packages which will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be considered weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for vacation employment were announced one day later as the rival U@@ PS that plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra labour , approximately the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of the analysts , poll@@ ed by Z@@ ack , expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at their most awaited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve polic@@ emen spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening above them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all the other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : to keep US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives timi@@ dly reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what makes the financial market unsure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rate of interest this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argued that an interest rate would ease the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looked at as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , head econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the threshold of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when interest should be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ tu Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he predic@@ ts that they will be waiting for at least one month to get the effect better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in their decision @-@ making process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could restrict its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . I observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that with apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ ner , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets up for a rate of interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as market collapse in 2008 , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngest turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds twice the mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should hurry ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes Chinese Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and cro@@ ckery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is even a car department , if you need engine oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the store is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ ark@@ √º@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s , and has various pick @-@ up options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; products are cheap , and a number of them are sold in large quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the bar will clean and le@@ ash the fish and even fry them on request for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good part of the store is part of the massive freezing department . here you can find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef stock , fish balls , commercially prepared food and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the Cas@@ hier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown , a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own car park , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Help for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people supporting non @-@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to them , Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with her 74 L@@ ences , she still teaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is quite different than at a proper school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization , SP@@ RS , tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ol@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited gymnas@@ tics hall at the Bern@@ ol@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction contract has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the committee had decided to include a motion application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with non @-@ ground first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning stage is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; in doing so , we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; says mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again the roof tilt which was prescribed for energy reasons - different from the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in relation to roof@@ ing does not allow &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , during gymnas@@ tics , there is no recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and public transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the district office for testing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital , P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg , should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees , move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer , and the further existing inside station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff were informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now shifting to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case means an &quot; upgrade &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years , fis@@ her with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to this , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference psychology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer of the Qu@@ asi parade to the Le@@ ch , who had been received positively and comprehen@@ si@@ bly by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer works as a chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded today in the evening ( 8 pm ) , in the Berg@@ ischen HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wuppertal , the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite , but there is none . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the public bath@@ ers in the Bh@@ c run a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ ger case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon , two tractor drivers had been seriously wounded by shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the removal on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Wit@@ tenberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a firing , 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ old , who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year old who was arrested on Tuesday evening was also considered suspect and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday mor@@ nings , after having come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of surveys among friends of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put an attack on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further investigation should bring about the closer circumstances of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even more refugees are seeking an affordable lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with poor citizens around the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the Association of Social H@@ ousing was commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial lodging shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stum@@ ble onto the housing market , and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers live in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the study also makes significant failures in the residential construction policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany now shoots an apartment deficit that gets bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas already some 77@@ ,000 residential units , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , many professionals were living in large cities in need of WG @-@ rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the mira@@ ges in the apartment market , young adults stayed no longer at the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the property tax can be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding programme for refugee accommodation of the Bundes@@ bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros were already claimed on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free ra@@ dicals : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no getting through to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb is announ@@ cing the opportunity to pass through Slovenia to the north , without hur@@ dles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with Slov@@ ene Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day before , Hungary had un@@ locked its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also virtually eliminating proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; they can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they came to the Serbian border town S@@ id , both by bus and taxis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot over the green border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the border crossing poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people challenged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws prohi@@ bit the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed Hungarian border town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned threatened prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , there was a total of 94 asylum applications established on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected the garbage , which tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side in the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barriers were broken down , and one of the recording camps in the border was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the country has reinforced its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mayor drove out &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly there were ten people with travel k@@ off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but because Germany had unexpectedly set the railway traffic with Austria because of the influ@@ x of refugees on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snacks and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man did not let him take a generous donation , 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the train passengers had switched to a regional train in direction to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional train , however , was placed in front of the W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday agreed on Sunday , preceded by a two @-@ year running - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends tens of thousands to us , a logical result of an apparent policy is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in establishing structures , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to see that the &quot; landed country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the persistent influ@@ x of refugees and the coming winter to produce decent conditions for people looking for protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ y districts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the discharge of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad , however , is accustomed to his word weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers , to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the first acceptance centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without big fuss , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the whole , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ nal year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 of them are to provide 15,000 to the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heads of the state , he has already held talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , to create districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations on the ORF action &quot; Help , as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in periods of time , it cannot be that j@@ amm@@ ers must respect a certain amount of towel holders or gran@@ deur of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he founded Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man who doesn &apos;t say the un@@ truth without further notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to bear any cost , as they stated themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , their own quest for districts has not been successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are obviously problems with the approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an emergency , however , further sites should be checked for suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criticism of the city chief at the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , too , other districts must make their contribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday announced further proceedings in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me , that the German borders were not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the prot@@ esters would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general san@@ itation of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neues Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is entered , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can imagine investing in New Adverti@@ se companies in Star@@ tup companies , and later acquire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ propriet@@ or opened second business in the ar@@ cade
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to have a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni was forced to post@@ p@@ one this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : after all , it has gained momentum in the form of another business unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her fashion @-@ interest has put her mother into the cra@@ dle , her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into a rap@@ ture , also the house@@ wife cannot answer with the latest safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is because a nice bag does every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a town , known as An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for setting off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is foreign hostile to foreign journalists , journalists or gaps in knowledge are revealed in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office will che@@ er up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker , with the wholes@@ ome hair@@ style , is well known for many in the wine village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people in the 1,@@ 200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ town are related to him over ump@@ teen corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del directed a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which besides Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not bring it to the king of hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold graves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed at the Bavarian state at which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jump be the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants , this stands in contrast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA , claiming the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the pol@@ lin@@ t , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ son was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so upright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pension engineer Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better if he doesn &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sag@@ as at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 children , and also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are ha@@ iling to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no great shifts in Today &apos;s Reviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was hiding in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the stand seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the closing of the Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August Today , Today average reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 proceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September Sun@@ rise has a total of 34@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of change , these morning people are more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ael Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently injured father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe revealed 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident , that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally published as &apos; Sun@@ rise dominated , while Today &apos; remains &apos; local &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are possibly unknow@@ ingly showing who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one , who received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may accidentally notice who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitudes as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If you are not , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a very easy relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams , I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was pretty compatible throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked what Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , at Ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a b@@ m as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return , and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a reinforced Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ in at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers hoping for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne pos@@ ing for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gay
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky and Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man was arrested on a Siber@@ ian tur@@ f by force of arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was accused of sei@@ zing his oil company Yu@@ ko and prevented his democratic efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free elec@@ tors demand the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , totally different main topics were planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administration courts that are responsible for asylum suits : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards in federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have to become more responsive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional politics in big wall@@ stadt should not fall below the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long time favourite is on the agenda : the policy of education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; intermediate class plus &quot; which will be tested for three to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free drive to G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tigh@@ ten Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed trend @-@ free and nervous trading history with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon , a solid kick @-@ off of the US stock markets provided a clear direction , which finally promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the indicator of the euro@@ zone , decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid gains were also attributable to commercial places in London and Paris , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index recorded around 1 percent in Plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the bro@@ kers expect the markets to be put on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US , and also to the large failure on the fut@@ ures exchanges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep marks even in E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government denied the numbers , called in the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Da@@ x @-@ tip , Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report by the US magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , investors are giving too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , investment in future @-@ oriented w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid to the car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW , respectively , increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 1.@@ 26 percent , Volkswagen benefits were driving down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the German pension market , the return on listed federal documents fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points , the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , the price of the euro sank to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ ic , senior official officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ hak@@ ic said , the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they picked up on rubber bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which they may kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high rate of death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese southern levels where members of the ethnic group of hes@@ itation say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a building site planned in the city
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre , Old Post is to be built again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the city is preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to mix trade , trade and housing - but there are no concrete proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market a land of about 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wait for appropriate offers , that is to say from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what investor to do is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts have been signed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner Gro√üe Stra√üe , already a few months ago and let the buildings rip it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday resort on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some applicants are further worried , they fear the sale of their free time activities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months @-@ long was negotiated , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new holiday resort on the little sea are near Em@@ den on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the City Development Committee of the Council of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which submitted to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach left the system @-@ building management : &quot; we did not answer all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and over 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the project &apos;s roughly ten to twelve million euros has been in discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent reactions among hor@@ se@@ power owners , who had come to the meeting , produced the images and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Marine Ow@@ ner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole bus loads so that this pays off , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sex of the new@@ born gor@@ illa tw@@ ins is not yet determined , as Mother Di@@ an keeps her close to her body so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the U.S. National Hurri@@ cane Center predicted a broad @-@ pressure system about 350 miles ( 5@@ 60 km ) south of the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most Cape Verde islands , which has a 60 % chance to develop in the next 48 hours to a tropical cycl@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund@@ raising campaign to help thousands of refugees swept over by thousands of refugees , as they fled from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of making the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google associate who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Malteser International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global funds raised globally , up to a value of $ 5.5 million , will be doubled to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria that has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many flee from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ umb
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for slightly overweight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery are longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan used Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c hose formation - for people who were slightly overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the Diabetes disease was completely dissolved and 28 % in part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared with diabetes , the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group was reduced to only one percent and partially with only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the medical therapy group remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and rather a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of greater people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , obesity was overweight by 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have permanently connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√º@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a subject that is currently attracting attention in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the s@@ warm of her youth after years and falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r√º@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler , and is pleased that she could set up a literary memorial to her home town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ am@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing will be less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US dragged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 @-@ fold increase in consumption of suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants , by children in the past 4 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ isons control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which strongly swallow alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children were drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ ens have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection with soft mou@@ th@@ water , in order to get a harder drink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive to children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation in particular for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison@@ ous emergency Centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry and disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice above the threshold that is legally drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them outside Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trauma , because the girl fell through the alcohol and had found his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ infection products out of the reach of the child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teacher is highly allergic to suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants , and ban@@ ished them from their room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the ser@@ ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ jects disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a collision at the cross p@@ liers between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ dem , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist has been slightly injured during a collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross bar towards the industrial area , and became too late that two vehicle drivers had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vehicles participating in the accident , damage to the police was about 10,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer pass@@ able , and had to be tow@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rum@@ or &apos;s Kitchen : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths are playing the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will do it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA for the accus@@ ation of N@@ eil@@ son and war@@ bur@@ ton being cau@@ tious in January @-@ new obligations that could destroy the unit of the squ@@ ad
D@@ ons raise leadership over Celtic to five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ ph@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the d@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . it insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch stand@@ ings leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Nieder@@ l√§nder - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that is what interests them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will spin things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wore to turn things upside down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this , but we have to continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need Celtic support , because that makes the players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , together , it is so important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing New Rel@@ eases and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players who come in summer , have this Pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference to return notes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome nu@@ ck@@ les for two years , and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle posted for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts resulted in 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defence was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts , &quot; I have no integrity questioned , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he admitted , he sang a song with offensive lyrics about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the St√ºr@@ mer , &quot; It is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if not for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice supervisory board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things upside down , but confess that the decline has to end on the playing field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es was happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to win a seventh consecutive league victory that made them one of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything in po@@ k@@ ebo@@ ards or li@@ lies that have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is rising overall in the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ONS ) showed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime occupation in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago , that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bother@@ ed the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as security guards were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a respir@@ ation alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ les and remained in custody at first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why I am witn@@ essing an ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be selected , will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed for me to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , on Twitter , accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoner as he wants , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better shape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present , to write there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series that I have made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would condemn him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe there is a strong probability , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective , I will see him dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porters , which you can turn to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after damp police chase , persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he over@@ talked the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man from Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called for a break in peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not very enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him , and threaten to finish racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he points to ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , last straw on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt tu@@ cked test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know , that it continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tonight , I will go home tonight and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to walk around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a trainer anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , I must think about what I do with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had reported the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department tried to pick up his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - which I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they obviously believe that I am a che@@ ater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to believe me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should this bring me to the conclusion , that it will be personal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe people out there , that I &apos;m there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s stration levels have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting ob@@ session , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license across the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ failing Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , called the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse &apos;s bill , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators wrong@@ ly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was , however , also on the race day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was arrested for driver flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and then driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycli@@ st was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries by helicopter , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is expected to be charged with ill @-@ ev@@ asion and under @-@ leaving assistance , and for other traffic off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy , beating against ri@@ vals for claims of ring fight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a very short remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team and said that during the tac@@ kling , she just concentrated on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team strongly agree with him , because they thought they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always comes up again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ disputes when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is funny , as it always appears at this time of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a divorce dirty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger faith , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. cow@@ boys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are breaks , and no points any tension ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ security deposit after drug delivery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could possibly face life imprisonment for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argued that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of floo@@ ding at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to reach his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ ghty explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , reported daily by the police and detained at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noted it too late , and in vain tried to turn to the left , as the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it , found the be@@ wil@@ dered messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , using concepts for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did , to l@@ ure them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone , and confronted the accused with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused had used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have viol@@ ated illegal pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was taken up before the date of the sentence , into the list of sexual offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad @-@ user switches to Germany from small border cross@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people , from fear of discovery and arrest , increased the number of people at smaller cross @-@ border cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had come to the German side by foot , over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they are sent to reception by Federal Police , and forwarded to the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Munich main station met considerably more refugees in comparison to the weekly beginning on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8 : 00 , said one speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected in the southwest of Stuttgart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a low pressure region on Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country currently , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strong storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars that are currently particularly well selling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August , this segment alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel launches its entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current Astra is 9,@@ 90 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine , with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is now only five @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what &apos;s next , next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an emphasizes sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then as a combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment , Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan feeder wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adapts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe , in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ er were especially on the front panel : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the correc@@ tor prison , who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , an ex in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was lod@@ ged in an individual cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was once again on a free foot , moved to a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his term of responsibility for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin , though , failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and re@@ mitted the case to re@@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons , for legal reasons , a few days of imprisonment for compensation had been decisive for compensation , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in April , they said compensation for in@@ mates because he was locked in a cell naked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a decision from 2011 , human dignity is also un@@ worthy of a separate toilet without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged in a similar cell between 15 and 21 hours a day like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , Berlin &apos;s pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even the cl@@ ashes should have been due to the tense situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany will even be able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do it and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the lack of living space is dramatic above all for affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of the rental price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is much too little , from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments annually would have to be developed , and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , scientists and federal mini@@ stries are agreed that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them start their career , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt in Germany , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a job ban for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , it has also enforced the views that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lack of knowledge of German is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , there is still no adequate offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the building up of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ ro@@ uted parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ woman for youth and family in the Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to convince the family , however , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students without a knowledge of German are prepared for classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal state is prohibited asylum seekers or imposed the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has quit his position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a stay refund or D@@ ul@@ mouth do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the latter don &apos;t get a bear , because they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this gap must be closed , and Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk are challenged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately , the students should receive B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should give succ@@ essively the same rights to Islam as it has the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a willingness to heed religious fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concerns on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to avoid such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , integration will be much more than today an issue of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and an equality law since a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees so far , says Medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do this , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests all newcom@@ ers right at the registration of health cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rendered services could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited catalogue of performance that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the doctors make the language barriers above all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse than their illnesses than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have helped many refugees , however , with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugees , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and for the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partly remaining disease pictures German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take the exam again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ Psych@@ otherap@@ ist@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flas@@ hes of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong trem@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only four per cent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can make a request for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst uses the tradition of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on a brick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the gift to lovers lies in the family in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program of the Cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded at the International cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban du@@ et wants to pick up the Cuban du@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light@@ ness and agi@@ lity , with these words they identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and agi@@ lity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy each stro@@ king unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the top commandment is good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is very proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals lived in a nest for eight years , and nothing happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there is something for every visitor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with our whole heart here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from September 17 to 20 , every day at 5 : 00 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6@@ pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month , they rested and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politi@@ cian SMS messages received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokesperson said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and HP said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company which was founded by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in the 1930s to produce electrical systems and the Pal@@ o Alto Garage called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has undergone a massive restructuring , in order to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand at Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger stressed that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere won &apos;t miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great dis@@ grace on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old swing back during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of violation does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bone , which does not heal well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in touch with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognizes , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most vulnerable days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last for the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a temporary period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta might start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites from group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , it was 10th in Zagreb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco , and remains from the far@@ away hope to lead the club to his first European victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out with arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons about male friendship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , particularly in terms of how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ects ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friendship is the heart of the battle , to overcome this challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course , one has to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beauty of Friends was , that this focus was placed on the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments while sitting in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely refer to them completely to explore their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing it told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk has clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying , &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of male friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you visit this weekend of Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the backdrop to celebrate the day totally re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani on his hits against Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PS@@ G , di Maria goes on to Malm@@ √∂ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ haft Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it not only asp@@ ires to qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while they got the points it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team that held a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and &apos;s long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that stage , entered the field with nine national players and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin &apos;s pole posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ hes and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was left alone in the first half after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was turned by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . therefore , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz &apos;s final result , before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champi@@ ons League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through share sales
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of its huge educational plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share jumped by 2.6 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its 30 billion $ debt , announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4@@ 40 @-@ PS sports car borrow@@ ed and driven to S@@ cra@@ p
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfill a dream , and gave himself a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the wet highway , the evil awakening came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can meet the dream and once again bor@@ row a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 4@@ 40 hp and drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , this was also a 29 year old from the district of Got@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the A 71 at Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , fell on wet driving and drove into the guard rail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports car suffered total harm , no one was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented the change from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion League winner , two times champion league , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the registered , too , the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in memory : in summer 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardian was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the change did not come about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and today , the decisive man is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains , why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protag@@ onist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not at the filling of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments by the act@@ ress by The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a nut@@ ty , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o , the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the film directing rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time , at the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national impact and urged authorities and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent times , the leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contest @-@ show , which just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock of the profit of the big prize of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved or lived more than 10,000 dollars , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten did not get any prize money at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , he receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he swe@@ eps anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Isaac felt just the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit tiger grin@@ ds past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once upon a time , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ wins made a chance for Ascension within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros , for the second American League Wild@@ card Square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two pati@@ os , then once in sixth and then again in ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings , and made three rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in bul@@ l@@ bars , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three rounds at the end of the seventh ring , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man faced with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run d@@ enture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit benefited from the opening of the game of an even not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list before the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I got rid of it and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch da in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the lead in the first place , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z , Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z brought a single &quot; up the middle &quot; to the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers grew up in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not beat well , but he got the right job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever right handed by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three rounds with six hits and a walk with four strips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the wor@@ shipping school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is crossed by the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since it was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since August 20 , he was missing because of a distortion in the right hip joint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees should perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who were there should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the town of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reck@@ oned with a refugee of 450 to 750 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen had arrived in Hessen according to data from the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the large number of refugees in sports halls , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by military participation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends against our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on both southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening on Austrian television station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not call concrete figures , and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann proposed a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , Germany had begun with temporary border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee tragedy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ up view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the round , this view was strongly divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on the night to Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie down the border with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from looking for ev@@ asive maneu@@ vering over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , there are thousands of immigrants coming to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ice cap of Saturn , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ ells a global ocean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the moon is easily deceived on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this movement is only small , but still too big for a permanent heavenly body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ama is missing in 1860 , Munich several weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around a month , 1860 Munich has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury on the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we must now think about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium last year , and earlier it was under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ √§ger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his conc@@ ussion next week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ot@@ ie had been injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , in a violent collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a severe veil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you want to look for its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar , mainly su@@ cro@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : there are B vitamins in them as well as vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruit thus supports the vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be stored at room temperature , and be consumed within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they taste pure , or in sweet foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man@@ go , however , gives a special touch to hearty dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Christmas business in the USA , the US package service U@@ PS re@@ stores up to 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , drivers are looked for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its staff for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had made a sharp criticism of the parcel services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first f@@ low@@ tower and then striking cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night falls in the valleys of the F@@ √∂hn side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and Thursday night , the F@@ √∂hn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ole valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after flying on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful Sou@@ thwest current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the mountain@@ side , the night falls to the Wednesday of the F@@ √∂hn through the valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in consequence , the F@@ √∂hn blows up to Thursday morning in the hol@@ lows of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with more than 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can penetrate up to the neighbouring Plateau , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , thermal hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , South of the Alps need to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning the blow fa@@ des out the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the cold front , the wind rises heavily to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures drop considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honored as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could live only in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) , as a young August@@ iner , stopped at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he felt the city at that time , as a rotten sin @-@ bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to historians , his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel , Luther initiated the split of the Western Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus , with the gil@@ ded crown of thorns , is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and refres@@ hed Bible texts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , was the word ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Testament , which is now published with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote in 150 designs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cycles arising from topics such as cross @-@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood have ar@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is on the basis of painting with the respective Bible points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current connections into today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embedded in the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ ps has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , emotions were the cause of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to bear witness to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to return art to more significance in the quick@@ time period : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artists have a different desire and delight , to show things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to look down into the images , let them look down , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot; I like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he gras@@ ps life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old did not pay attention to the Bible to fully grasp the Bible , but the most important , also mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation on November 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway is approaching
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth@@ bound for a round course mod@@ eled : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail it was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ink@@ age , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so hill down , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , and the first joint @-@ party Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to inform the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will be even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B will expand its engagement for refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the sit@@ ing situation in Germany , and ass@@ ures its help in dealing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mr@@ s √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football can , and may help , help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football League has extended its Refu@@ gee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , some Bundes@@ liga @-@ lists support this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will be given the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football allies , no , we must use our beam force , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup against Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 license clubs in their locations had started their own projects , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as great is , that small and small clubs are active there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP executive board loses an eye in case of an accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the US he dropped onto a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ shed , was power@@ less , then dragged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ √Ñ ce@@ √¢ s co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go on his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting , and is fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , during the night race in Singapore he comes as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two stam@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach leaves : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its parent eleven on the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he announced a change on the door@@ keepers position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the Roman citizen Roman brus@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is employed in the future in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les made it open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high probability , he will also dispute the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the forward statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says Julian Wei@@ gl for track@@ able : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological leader in the change of the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , intends to invest in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt was on the ver@@ ge of IA@@ A by a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , said Mr. Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who will also come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy shift to digital radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a way , Germany wants to use it internationally to ensure that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany will value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars in the coming ten years believe that 31 percent do not believe in anything at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents poll@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to have control over the entire drive on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 15 percent of the traffic could be expected on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth of them would give the car the control under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current status in the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , the D√ºsseldorf will only want to beat in the single one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final decision should be made at the latest , on September 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re strong enough to take the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf in D√ºsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became European Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves with this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United , bred a heavy injury on the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was taken at a Tac@@ kling of H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 20 , Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ furt &apos;s first diagnosis pointed to a ship@@ wre@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights are display mannequins , which look incredibly human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and with the fact that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle in the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good idea that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had previously been held in Montreal , Canada , and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever completing his training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work that was practi@@ sed for a lot of effort : for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have lost 14 tons of material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stands for the first , agile fashion attempts of the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , he taught the designing of fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I bought them , but of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first show , he didn &apos;t have to pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was about the long nitrogen engines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in a large amount for customers , for example to work on blankets and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director at P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s fashion school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early stages of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past bul@@ lets , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already account for half of all jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , Sp@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association of P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ aces and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is almost no more private specialist shops , as well as wholesale trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , our products hardly reach the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , exports are weak@@ ening , up to date to Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , enough reasons for new ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly modified to hold a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the machine embroi@@ dered small balls at some spots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith masters Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took his inspiration from this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t do anything with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still v@@ entures into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; is not a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family , in times of the world economic crisis in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands : Ro@@ b Marshall , last time with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday , a group commissioned by the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , e@@ asing border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital and over@@ haul of the villa@@ gers &apos; system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after and after , the system is tested and improved by test programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it assign@@ s a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and is open to the market , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen the powers transferred to the company , and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will permit border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus help consumers get a clearly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and small children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ der or s@@ word@@ fish should be increased from one milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already keeping the planned limits today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ gu@@ ous distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wolfgang Sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on its homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , mercury gets into the environment through coal burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount of total emissions emit@@ ted in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
