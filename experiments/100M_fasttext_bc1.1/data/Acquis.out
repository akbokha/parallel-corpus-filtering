&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Convention means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the objective of the procedures defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear power from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery .
in order to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the review by the organization is carried out by means of an explanation in which the quantity of material not proven for a particular period of time is specified by the accuracy limits for the specified dimensions .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in applying their security measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are more determined and practical in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the amounts of , produced , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) process for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system that indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures following this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) will establish ur@@ an@@ ium - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , in the States , the community of the organisation shares the amount and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) The core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not authorised , however , if the provisions under Article 11 are not possible or desired , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable preventive measures .
B ) The precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community dis@@ appro@@ ve that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the core material that would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards pursuant to this Convention , provided that the total amount of nuclear material delivered in the States is no longer at no time at all due to this article in the states .
a ) a kilogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if a liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core materials that are subject to the safety measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures to that material .
the Community meets with the Organization of Suppl@@ ementary Termin@@ ations , which is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail how the procedures stipulated in the Convention shall be applied .
the amend@@ ment may be extended or amended without modification of the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organisation , based on the initial report cited in Article 62 , presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the whole , the security measures of this Convention underlying nuclear material in the states regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their audit .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action plan set at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource @-@ transportation problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force is issued in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; special action account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is managed by the organization as a custo@@ dian and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) Payment will be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( though i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may make payments before the above dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator will take approximately proportional draw on the cash or the issu@@ ers to cover the expenses for the ac@@ re@@ tional loan and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources .
every single transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including sec@@ toral plan ) , which is considered , approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices used for the organization of the organization financed by ordinary funds of the organization , with the aim of this agreement mentioned in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this Agreement .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in only 10 years each in 50 years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this fee must be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is given in particular .
the income from any loan loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which could be the recipient of a special action loan granted at the time of loan granted .
capital re@@ payments from a special bond are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
until full disclosure of all loans from the EEC , the administrator shall instruc@@ t the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payout of the special ac@@ re@@ tional loan , the administrator will inform the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expenses for that .
the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with a statement by the external audi@@ tors of the organization at this account .
as soon as possible , the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the interaction account .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts recei@@ pts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account , the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments made to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of a special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action loans , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may , if necessary , the agreement and all obligations of the parties arising there@@ from are due immediately .
if the total amount of capital is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from will be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure in question .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is dra@@ fted in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally author@@ itative .
whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter exchange to am@@ end the App@@ endi@@ x A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :

in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff names in the event of renewed changes in the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contractual parties in the future , it appears further to include an article 12 up to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the agreement of the Community regarding these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the previous one .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the agreement of your government to the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks propose a corresponding application .
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor &apos;s country , within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions have already been mentioned below which the BI@@ S would be willing to use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extending extensions without exceeding five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
furthermore , it would be agreed that the first conc@@ essions are not made before the end of one month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would stretch for periods that would take account of the means of the Bank , expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the time specified under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to acquire the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor that has been raised by the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks propose a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would inform me of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honour myself to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents to the blood group regulation against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and promotion , as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , who need them urgently , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other parties only under the condition that it is not associated with any profit , that it is only used for medical purposes and only be supplied to places designated by the governments involved .
each con@@ sign@@ ment of re@@ agents to blood group determination must be accompanied by a certificate that they have been manufactured in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its system constitutes an administrative arrangement that may be amended or supplemented by governments of the contracting parties of this Convention .
the contracting parties take all the necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided by other parties to the blood group determination of all input donations .
they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances reach the receivers quickly and in the shortest possible way in Article 3 .
the contracting parties submit to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of places provided for the issu@@ ance of the certificate provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention concerning the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this agreement is for the members of the Council of Europe to sign up ; they can become contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or
this Convention shall enter into force one month after the day , at which three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied or approved according to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for any member , which later signs or appro@@ ves this Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it will enter into force one month after its signature or deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite every non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Member States a ) the date of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied or approved it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention in compliance with a period of one year by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance contained on the label .
( if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined for dup@@ licate in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively for the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being worked out .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter specifies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series with a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bulletin Organisation O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ hale release according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of shelf @-@ life tests ; it is approved by the national supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0,5 b.@@ H of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ us oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
the re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after re@@ plen@@ ishment , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally coloured , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents spent are stored for so long by the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to reinforce effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups based on the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container has a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
furthermore , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,

protocol to the 1979 Convention concerning the widespread deterioration of air pollution in relation to the fight against emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ fe@@ ver@@ ish river
concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ poll@@ uting substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural treasures of vital importance for the environment and the economy ,
remember that the executive body of the Convention on its second meeting has acknowledged the need to effectively reduce the annual emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and movable sources or their gr@@ en@@ ching flow until 1995 , and the need that states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions have maintained and check their emission limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their downstream products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ ching river , especially by applying suitable national emission limits for new movable larger fixed sources and retro@@ fitting existing larger stationary sources ,
in the knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge of these issues continue to develop and that this development must be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures ,
recogni@@ zing that the elabor@@ ation of a solution based on critical stress has the creation of an effective scientific basis for the purpose of taking into account the implementation of this protocol and the decision on further internationally agreed measures ,
recogni@@ zing that the rapid review of procedures for the creation of lower requirements for technology exchanges will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission &apos;s region ,
taking note of satisfaction that several states have ple@@ dged to mutually reduce their annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des and to considerable extent ,
mind@@ ful of the measures already taken by some states that have caused a reduction in the emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des ,
