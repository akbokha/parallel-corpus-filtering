<seg id="728">The organisation, based on the initial report cited in Article 62, presents a summarized inventory of the whole, the security measures of this Convention underlying nuclear material in the states regardless of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their audit.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action plan set at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource-transportation problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force is issued in the form of loans, and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "special action account," which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is managed by the organization as a custodian and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "administrator"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest bonds of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organisation in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment will be made in two instalments (though i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments before the above dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator will take approximately proportional draw on the cash or the issuers to cover the expenses for the acretional loan and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting this loan, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every single transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including sectoral plan), which is considered, approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices used for the organization of the organization financed by ordinary funds of the organization, with the aim of this agreement mentioned in the letter b) of the preamble to this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in only 10 years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction Loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this fee must be paid directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from any loan loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which could be the recipient of a special action loan granted at the time of loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special bond are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full disclosure of all loans from the EEC, the administrator shall instruct the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payout of the special acretional loan, the administrator will inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special loans and the expenses for that.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator obliges the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with a statement by the external auditors of the organization at this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">As soon as possible, the administrator of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the interaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts receipts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid from the account, the amounts paid to the account and the repayments made to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker until the full issue of the funds of a special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action loans, and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the organisation may, if necessary, the agreement and all obligations of the parties arising therefrom are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting therefrom will be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
