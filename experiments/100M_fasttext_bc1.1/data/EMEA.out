this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. entertaining thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not available ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who are preparing difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the transmission of signals between brain cells by means of &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is believed to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ onic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurring .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drug ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb .
in both studies with injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg were significantly reduced in symptoms than those who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the course of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
furthermore , up to 74 weeks , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and severe to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
moreover , the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approved for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even when treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no hei@@ gh@@ tened risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ re@@ pu@@ te and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy are treating signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there were , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % whereas the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l results in extensive metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 incu@@ b@@ ators with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weigh@@ ed for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying treatment .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ morph@@ ine ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns created in animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned against handling dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under a plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a generally lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was found in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under high @-@ gloss therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse reactions reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ test in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a effectiveness in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed themselves superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ war@@ dness , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination date is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabolism of the metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects were observed .
a review @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences concerning eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 @-@ 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1- to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ tig@@ m@@ atism and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and begin with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended to circum@@ vent adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drug already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ oxi@@ fication and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to an extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ re@@ pu@@ te and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ates , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing the glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were administered in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly as in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying treatment .

the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under a plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was found in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the adverse reactions reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance was observed because of reduced patient population .
in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an och@@ re @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superi@@ ority in the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ war@@ dness , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 m@@ g. in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there was no safety @-@ relevant concern following mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1- to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the central steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three @-@ quarters of which had previously been an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients for treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy contra@@ indications such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously had other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmaceuticals .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that in patients with the first treatment , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines and that unlike other medicines , it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic grade 3 treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached at degrees 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impaired kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have other pharmac@@ ological characteristics other than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease .
in case patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these patients can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ esis and con@@ sti@@ g@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) which can affect the traffic consistency and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most distinctive ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the jaw , loose stool , o@@ e@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax , weakness of the muscles , back pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , sore throat , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al link established with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the pooling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bular indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in im@@ parts trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ i@@ endo@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and acts as pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic potential .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity over pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous dosage of m@@ amma cancer in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft location of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean for cum@@ ulative urine leak@@ age was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data were available to patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ ised medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing on the market will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • Desig@@ ning the correct use of the product with a clear picture of the correct use of the product .
this means that Ab@@ sen@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood don@@ or is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed was compared with injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before being either switched to Ab@@ sen@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 weeks .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ sen@@ amed inj@@ ected under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ sen@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ alp showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ sen@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any other component .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ab@@ sen@@ amed has provided proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which manufactures Ab@@ sen@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Medi@@ ce Dru@@ gs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of Ab@@ sen@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
Ab@@ sen@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are used , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and disease status .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall burden ; therefore , the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and disease status .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tic number to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the amount of reproduci@@ bility of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tic number to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tes by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserved foods is required , should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins - large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients undergoing treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ sen@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ last@@ y ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous c@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ tis or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reproduci@@ bility should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxidation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. , the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ sen@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tic stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the use of epo@@ eti@@ ins if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al failure .
in tumour patients under chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dosage and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment of the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take account of the specific clinical context .
in patients fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the start of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa drugs should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ eti@@ n was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dosage should be adapted to increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ dem@@ ics , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , ather@@ os@@ clerosis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - general ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically engineered epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aerobic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression @-@ progression were studied in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transmitting a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
according to SC injection , the serum levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa ) .

prior to the launch and agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • Desig@@ ning the correct use of the product for transport by patients .
the holder of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is operational before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is applied in the intercourse .
the approval of the Marketing Plan pursuant to version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application is undertaken , as well as in accordance with each subsequent risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , an updated report should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical field vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures could have been achieved • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) • following request by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if for example , such a blood @-@ graf@@ ting occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which rec@@ edes again during further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be taken into consideration and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the beginning of the therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ last@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will cancel your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore Ab@@ sen@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and increase the risk of death .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ aging signs by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood poverty with Ab@@ sen@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dosage and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ sen@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood lip@@ id levels ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ sen@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events occur in the past ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , keep in mind that Ab@@ sen@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you expect a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed should investigate and treat the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the treatment begins .
if your blood lip@@ id levels ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ sen@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other drugs or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , your doctor may instruc@@ t certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
once you are well set , you get regular dos@@ ages of Ab@@ sen@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your physician considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ sen@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial folds of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ e@@ dem ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ sen@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed - to a drop of blood ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) if your output level is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or if you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .

Ac@@ la@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in the heart attack ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or inj@@ ected into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate acet@@ one .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood was again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spine frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo .
compared to patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ a provides educational material to physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out whenever they should consult the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ la@@ a in the entire European Union .

the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ation in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ a is recommended once a year .
patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures are recommended to admini@@ ster the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a , a long re@@ mission time was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first acet@@ one in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ a is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ z@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients need@@ ing dental intervention , no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe adverse events reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions related to kidney function decline ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ( measured each year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired kidney function were in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ oni@@ as compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ oni@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ oni@@ as in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been studied , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ opathic arthritis in the jaw area in one patient with Ac@@ la@@ a and a plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , intraven@@ ous calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of acet@@ one 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 1.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral body frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and , after one year , the frequency of one or more new spine frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % lower risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ a showed an unchanged effect over three years resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effects on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ a increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hips by 6.0 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ g ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular layer of bone and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular mes@@ opor@@ osis in patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of the study .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ a reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with acet@@ one compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ a treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and sh@@ ank compared to all points of time .
over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ a treatment led to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total th@@ igh and by 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in males ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of acet@@ oni@@ um was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , particularly mild to moderate @-@ weight mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the average age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed in comparison with the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responding to therapy ) could be included in the follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was maintained in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ sier independent .
after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4@@ h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zinc @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a decreased Clear@@ ance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clearance , and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction up to 35 ml / min does not require tin adaptation of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since severe kidney function disorder ( cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest single dose intraven@@ ous single dose for mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in the case of studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage corresponding to the 6@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
the most common findings in trials involving repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum @-@ calcium levels .

ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving the bone its strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ a .
when using Ac@@ la@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken other drugs or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ a along with food and drinks , be sure to take enough liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broke the hips , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ la@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ a can act longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before stopping the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a If you are considering ending the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a , please contact your doctor for the next appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ a .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform acet@@ one in@@ fusion two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a , the patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ ca@@ emia may develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a .

A@@ compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which are obes@@ e ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or several
in addition , four studies have been carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of accompli@@ a in this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Conc@@ eption Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic agent or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic agent , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos increased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ ine for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c acid , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin received a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced macro@@ vascular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used in patients with increased outcome of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued should be guided by the clinical evaluation prior to the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be ag@@ grav@@ ated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .

after the market launch a reduction of visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole @-@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but killing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment should be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is because , under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal are reduced and the availability of metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .

since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in groups treated with comparative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show symptoms .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been shown to reduce glucose production in the liver and increase the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for more than two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect has been added ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials of one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week @-@ long study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however , clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced total plastic gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas values reduced under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereas the top concentrations on un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror indicating that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as compared to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ anes have to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( see the complete list of the packages ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with prolonged lasting effects .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage is required .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain advice from his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
the active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
it may also be necessary to adjust the doses of acet@@ one if it is given along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two kinds of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is fast acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin @-@ active insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain advice from his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the place of administration Gel@@ eg@@ lass - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma on the injection site ) may occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that the mortality induced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of the activity amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin humane in in@@ fusion fluids 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain advice from his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of de@@ formations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ums ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , there may still be cases of g@@ out ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic have other medicines for preventing g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drugs ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering ur@@ ic acid in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also take a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to pri@@ mal deposits ( including a rheum@@ atic node known or currently present in the medical history and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum urine acid levels still exceed 2 @-@ 4 weeks &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated ( C@@ ret@@ an Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplantation The use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ os@@ ur@@ ic medications , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the course of the treatment because it is possible to mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the serum .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was not carried out any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhi@@ bit of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adaptation for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that con@@ current sei@@ z@@ ure containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed capture of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not cause side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups overall more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness of skin , skin tone , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ic , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in blood concentration in blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum urine acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum concentration of serum to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum concentration &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( ie ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum concentration levels in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of serum suppl@@ em@@ entation of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the sustained reduction of serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic stro@@ kes ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the toxic@@ ity , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h nodes until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in urine was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , acet@@ oni@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ oni@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to normal kidney function .
the mean overall AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7.5 μ to 13.@@ 2 m / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chill @-@ buffer @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after intake of multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , at about 11 @-@ times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproduction of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the human exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied with a reduction in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human exposure , did not result in ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not lie down until after the first eating of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , tap@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic crashing .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other components .
it must not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of ch@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible radi@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular pain or new or deterior@@ ating heart@@ burn to collect the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ch@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no hei@@ gh@@ tened risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a ( after market launch ) , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available that indicates whether the absorption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a jaw surgical intervention reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the pill the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported .
nevertheless , decreases in serum cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups occurred with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at If an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

after 15 weeks of treatment the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
the therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tur@@ in@@ incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture inter@@ vention@@ - study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to adhere to ; also the BM@@ D of fem@@ oral and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spine frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distri@@ butions of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively tagged substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .

mean maximum concentration in the serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation Vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively lab@@ eled vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , 4.@@ 9 % in the rot@@ ting after 4 days .
characteristics in patients pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ance is administered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( e.g. by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful if others ( in particular some herbal ) medicine should be taken at the same time as Adv@@ ant@@ ages as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose of the medication used at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection requirements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients on Day 4 .
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after the transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , adap@@ ting the advance dose schema can last several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
in order to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ sation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - If Pro@@ gra@@ f switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , this conversion has to take place at ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to advance once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ ts In adult patients who are converted to a point of view , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with advanced pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ t patients , came to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day for patients with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
can adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients suffering from severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine , and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to paragraph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
blood flow levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were also to be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ anc@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or simultaneous use of substances which could change the whole blood circulation ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ance is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be more effective compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation , Adv@@ agra@@ ph , are available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formula Adv@@ agra@@ ph are available .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy which can therefore also occur under paragraph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothes or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , cr@@ amps and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination should be ( e.@@ g . ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption are special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with the same application of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain constant concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhi@@ bit ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be taken particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of examinations on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly as@@ cer@@ tained because of the disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of non @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
because of its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
the mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should be medi@@ ated by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells depending on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ inen ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f administered twice daily after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following pancre@@ atic , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the findings in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ enter study of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the gen@@ esis of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans was compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ forced by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t A multi @-@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted in 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation which was random@@ ised to receive a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs across the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ance was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be more effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ance is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug called Recom@@ bin@@ ate in the European Union , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86 % of 510 new hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the marketing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II @-@ plas@@ mas@@ her is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II pro kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dosage speed should follow after the patient has been found , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da Units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , which is the greatest risk within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional days and am@@ nes@@ ia of well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there is no experience regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the data available ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with mild to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported over @-@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from Factor X .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited awarded the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infection in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP insp@@ ected the company &apos;s responses to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP tag 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours presents benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that lawyers can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal would have consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to poll@@ en caused by poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents age 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is a tablet twice a day , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be followed on the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular disease , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk for an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic attack .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is generally swal@@ lowed ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ le@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data will not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be reli@@ eved .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder carcin@@ oma or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with ha@@ em@@ or@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo and those treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken by lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate or an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in an impair@@ ment of the traffic wickedness or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the hibition of the expression of the P @-@ Selec@@ tin gene on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight equ@@ ation including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , receiving 4@@ 14 patients with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
during a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on day 10 was achieved .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dos@@ sier study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n badly mixed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional research on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers for the human being .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose , and con@@ serving or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane causing pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a closure of stomach or du@@ oden@@ um , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( breathing difficulties due to a cr@@ amp of lung muscul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you may experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : high blood pressure • heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and head@@ aches or strengthening of existing headache .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken drugs , even if it is not prescription medicine .
when used in the recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot your dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

following the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes were reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle aches , var@@ ic@@ ose , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two trials in patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by as@@ cer@@ taining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ g@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution for insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed .
in the case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with chlor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be presum@@ ed that damage to traffic or ability to operate machinery may result .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with ha@@ em@@ or@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ phase clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the hibition of the expression of the P sel@@ ec@@ tin molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
a statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered daily for 14 days at a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the ne@@ op@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval revealed itself .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurements of the flight equ@@ ation including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of eti@@ ology , is similar in different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simply pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rup@@ s at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with ha@@ em@@ or@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patient demo@@ graphics with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of ha@@ em@@ or@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in vivo did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate or an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers for the human being .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with a@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se de@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance loading ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that metaboli@@ se restrictions is identical to that in children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ phase clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily di@@ gest@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the child population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied for over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( which was not twice the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not imp@@ air psych@@ om@@ otor disability .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment , nor to an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
according to the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the causes of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rup@@ s at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before applying the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet can be taken without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Si@@ rup@@ o and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the engaging formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread from humans to humans because people have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to make antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine , in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA ( E@@ MEA ) guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for further information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years associated with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of having the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids not cure can , however , delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of associated infection and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who were previously not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was fortified with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used earlier prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or changing viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few responded to the treatment .
in the study of adults treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine used with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r extracts the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued to take up their former prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are broken down just as axi@@ ally and are det@@ ri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood .
as in other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alterations in the body fat distribution ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years , the risks out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r amplifier , but the Committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ium as a solution to intake is 14 % less than Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to absence of data on safety and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day .
con@@ current use should take care of patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and are also the substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ el 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver ir@@ regul@@ arities with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ tical @-@ ero@@ id effects including Cus@@ hing Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ ate removal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy needed medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV condition and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and are also the substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ el 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose agents are metaboli@@ zed predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels with a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects were often observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already received Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ rus ring and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required if clo@@ ves are administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand 30 % lower , if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower , if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to observe closely mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with ammon@@ ium ( 600 mg twice a day ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in the side @-@ effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin must be at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ x@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can possibly result in interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may lead to res@@ or@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ c@@ ants which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of as@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected at the same time when A@@ gener@@ ase is administered .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
there is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used along with or@@ ally bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ ate removal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the dose if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the colon@@ isation to the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast feeding .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not impaired by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ ko@@ vic fat accumulation .
less than 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre@@ treated people treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull &apos;s eyes ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients had 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes usually were mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ gi@@ ven@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients receiving a@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ ite Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ e@@ as@@ eh@@ ammer @-@ mut@@ ations occurred :
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( dividing points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples produces a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral and non @-@ retro@@ viral patients , in which a f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ rus inhal@@ ed pattern ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , cavi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , cavi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , cavi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a promising therapy is recommended in order to prevent the accumulation of numerous mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which adults treated with PI treat vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ avi@@ al@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly associated with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI @-@ pre@@ treated children the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand lowered by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by food intake , although the con@@ current intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change results in a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amber which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily pren@@ atal exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day .
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is out of solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were encountered in male animals , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there is little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes contained , amber was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of e@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control rooms and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic exposure to plasma , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dos@@ ages in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us navigation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current use should take care of patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand 30 % lower , if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to observe closely mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ zone pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
con@@ current administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the colon@@ isation to the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ ite Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the potential benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account when optimizing the therapy with PI @-@ pre@@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were encountered in male animals , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele @-@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
however , there is little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amber was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control rooms and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in young the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ pp@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for inclusion was not occupied with PI @-@ pre@@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of ammon@@ ium as a solution to intake is 14 % less than Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for insertion and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ on , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be slow@@ ed down in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand 30 % lower , if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ col . ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the colon@@ isation to the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed .
premature termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended in order to prevent the accumulation of numerous mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI @-@ pre@@ treated children the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large volume of ve@@ to and an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be carried five times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks interval between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the skin surfaces before bed@@ time , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks , and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo was performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total radiation rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo showed a full recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption of the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub it in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .

in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with circumcision leading to circumcision were observed .
in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed even under proper application , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or have caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after a treatment with other SC applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al area there are no clinical experiences yet .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of ad@@ mitt@@ ance reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with respect to the elimination of cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy , or the reactions appear after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
since there are currently no data about long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent or pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lesser lik@@ el@@ ihood of responding to i@@ ro@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick area within the lip@@ stick .
very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oc@@ os@@ os in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ ro@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ ro@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were obtained neither after one @-@ time or repeated top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream pertaining to side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the reported side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects .
the most common , than likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects listed by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
this review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it often came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ment / dec@@ lining / sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often severe er@@ y@@ tales ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ composition and sal@@ utation ( 19 % ) came .
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of i@@ ro@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in relation to complete curing of the genital war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients cured completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ e@@ as@@ able scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications outside war@@ ts , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually arise in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and therefore were not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated semi @-@ evaluation period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application point .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected , a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the cream @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer period of interruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an interruption of treatment , caution must be handled cau@@ ti@@ ously .
treat 60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension to a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and ob@@ verse o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Inter@@ action related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of ser@@ o@@ con@@ flu@@ ence during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or to early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never been too ser@@ o@@ con@@ flu@@ ence .
patients with low or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the g@@ amma @-@ mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or decrease of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , even though adverse drug reactions were typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme replacement therapy lie in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulate substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of anticipated Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me had an improvement in lung function and vi@@ ability presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decline in the G@@ AG level was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of progression ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG level in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular dangers for the human being .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6. .

within the specified period , the holder of the marketing authorization has completed the following study programme , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion @-@ solution must be dil@@ uted before use and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and ob@@ verse o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
very common ( incidence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • red@@ dening • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Accor@@ ding to the body weight of each patient , first determine the number of th@@ inn@@ ed penet@@ rates .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an anti @-@ wr@@ inkle treatment ( anti @-@ vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood cell changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose is decreased .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural roots , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell prolifer@@ ation showed longer survival times than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each penet@@ rating bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is available in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for over@@ wie@@ v @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with chor@@ o@@ idal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid in the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood cell or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous therapy cycles .
after rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 treated for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient returns the value before treatment .
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ induc@@ tions an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Level 3 or 4 occurs or as a result of the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients at age 65 , or over the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ary limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reach a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as seen in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ amed if a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with emet@@ re@@ mixed need to be used as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce untreated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current consumption of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is intended , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ vers@@ cellular space drainage of the eff@@ usion will be considered before the tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive capacity by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm reservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to reduced tel@@ emet@@ ric elimination with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available regarding the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of emet@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , must be avoided at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ - .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy required an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
no data is available for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm reservation process before the start of the treatment .
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ ers are transferred to breast milk and undes@@ irable effects in the nursing inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency information : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontaneous reports ) .
* Reg@@ arding the National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for any degree of toxic@@ ity excluded from the &quot; kidney / genital tract &quot; event * * which was derived from the term &quot; kidney / genital tract others . &quot; * * * fla@@ yed to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , taste disorder and hair loss should only be reported as grade 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the consul@@ ted physician held a connection with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ conditioning included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 26@@ 5 patients random@@ ized to receive Herceptin and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 27@@ 6 patients random@@ ized to receive doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as mon@@ otherapy .
* * Reg@@ arding the National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , hair loss should only be reported as grade 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the advised physician held a connection with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ized p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to the combination of three single emet@@ re@@ mixed mono @-@ therapy studies ( n = 164 ) , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as significantly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could possibly be related to the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for inclusion of all events in which the reporting physician held a connection with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients receiving random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and emet@@ re@@ xed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ inde@@ xed :
severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular prolifer@@ ation , and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinical trials using tel@@ emet@@ ric an@@ tivi@@ ral medication which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
from clinical studies , cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fusion , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) were reported in patients with emet@@ re@@ xed treatment .
clinical studies occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure in patients with emet@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs were reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that tel@@ emet@@ re@@ taining acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ me syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of survival compared to those patients who were simply bund@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole carcin@@ oma arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function during the time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy won a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival occurred in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC in favour of Do@@ x@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine in c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of a concentrate solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy for treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural roots ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have a kidney disease or had one , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital provider as you may not receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
before any in@@ fusion blood tests will be carried out , checking whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor will possibly change the dose or stop the treatment unless it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after the c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin application .
if there is a liquid collection around the lungs , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you wish to be a child during the treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such drugs called non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including pharmaceuticals that are non @-@ prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take , and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , even if it is not subject to prescription drugs .
a hospital doctor , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( equivalent to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a twice a day ) , which you must take on the day before , during and the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take for once a day while using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 100 patients , but less than 1 of 10 patients were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this suggests that it has been reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 of 100 patients . if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it has been reported by at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) .
if you feel tired or weak , get quickly into breathing difficulties or look pale ( because you may have less hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) .
if you notice a bleeding of the gum , nose or mouth or any other bleeding that does not come to a stand@@ still , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you may have fewer blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats led to food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s of the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , stools , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( rot@@ ting ) , flat ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed by the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly patients and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Super@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Premature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of un@@ specified size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety with regard to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ lag@@ ging properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pi@@ ents .
it was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ tionally low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg - 3,5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline € 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline : 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules , resulting in increased fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of the treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related symptoms : • Start a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms will learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The container contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum per day .
see the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what quantity is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the effect of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight of approximately 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can only walk a little or even not , stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes hor@@ tic@@ ultural work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .

Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are powerful trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ ary ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ is was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ ic in the 24 hours after chemotherapy did not vom@@ it ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) versus 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ ic showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) versus 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in exc@@ essively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that leng@@ then the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ T interval prolonged or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and administration reactions ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing testim@@ onies .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an an@@ alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.2 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ron and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies of moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ gers .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical research , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of endo@@ genous pal@@ on os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous administration a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy individuals and cancer patients .
after IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was increased at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was equal to 3 consecutive days , the total score ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to a single intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the introduction of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found in the urine of 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
the overall length of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination date and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 In prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications have shown that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block i@@ onic channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results as for humans is low .
the holder of this approval for the placing of the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the medicine approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of the prescription for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ normally .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon has presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medical device to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to the clinical trial .
after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease rose again in more patients than with reference medicines ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was used to examine the question to what extent the drug dis@@ solves an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infections associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ sts ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con might not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions , or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effects of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface have not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations in humans after top@@ ical application on sc@@ rub@@ bed skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max under top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on sc@@ rub@@ bed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are insufficient in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin i@@ o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most common reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation was at the site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ tag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ wort ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear harmless at least some types of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ responding to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to people following top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 S@@ ized skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng / h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid l@@ esi@@ ons .
in vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 scre@@ ened skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during im@@ muni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines help to &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ enza contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 , has been approved for the V@@ acc@@ ine children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ et children are administered in the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as a receipt for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s protection was similar to six months and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is required for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a booster as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is achieved , so that the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary in these cases .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix may , however , be inj@@ ected by sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , as it can lead to bleeding after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ el vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ r@@ ty and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable high per volume ( i.e. over the entire in@@ oc@@ ulation cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ ence compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and intensity was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old V@@ acc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of in@@ oc@@ ulations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 according to the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme containing Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of formally in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ atic A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months in@@ oc@@ ulation scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year at the same time with the booster drop of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ on @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the present formulation as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes either before or after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .
in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge approval is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorised laboratory for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ ani can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been concluded with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses of vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly obtain a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per acc@@ ent ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ ent@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ ent@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ enza Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 inf@@ used cans ) : pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • irrit@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • O@@ ften symptoms • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that were reported to be very rare in the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 infected cans ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ ic@@ ular , swelling of the eye contours and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child will significantly affect or notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the granting of the first approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP has argued that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ moun@@ tis can also be used in patients aged over one month with in@@ completely enz@@ ym@@ atic enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ moun@@ t@@ aps - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ ach@@ er@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because am@@ mo@@ ons could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ don@@ tic medication , i.e. without active substance ) .
am@@ mo@@ ose can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ - , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents excessive ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of approval , only limited information on this medicine was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a delay manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life @-@ month ) there is an indication for use when an@@ am@@ n@@ esis consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ leu@@ scar@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty in swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ or@@ ming .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least an adverse event ( AE ) occurred at 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that containing sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease even led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ um ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delay manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ leu@@ scar@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , the plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ation .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ cle@@ us disorders or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma the next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma seal were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had not been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ leu@@ scar@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , in accordance with 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
on the basis of studies on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that containing sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form , the plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ation .
during durability , the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure includes a small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding , as the medicine could go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , slow@@ ing down the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood bil@@ let ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , rash , kidney problems , weight gain and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date shown on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ sage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS over the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ de ( tube that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al tube ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Al@@ low a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ ops of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with varying strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in all@@ ways or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the GP@@ I &apos;s ability to prevent new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of an@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , an emergency intervention or an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous rate of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed further , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before surgery a bolt can be administered of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT is shortened after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully bl@@ ended prior to application and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT att@@ aches more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients suffering from severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second intake of 0.3 mg / kg can be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us was administered with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional lifting par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• Sever@@ al hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the ha@@ em@@ as@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though most ble@@ ed@@ ings of arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can occur throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din reaches the level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggregate ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding .
in each case , the clinical and biological ha@@ emo@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding associated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone were significantly less frequent than in the groups with ha@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood vessel , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI examination .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was significantly less frequent than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice following extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed into table 6 according to system classes .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox@@ in contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and in the an@@ ion bin@@ dings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din had no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or es@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients receiving a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary Intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide enters into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or given as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter exposure times than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin logic .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra versus 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal area .
due to reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of activity , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in insulin requirements .
3 inadequate dosing or abor@@ tion of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin which is used and can therefore change in the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amid , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
in the following , the undes@@ irable drug reactions known from clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed by system classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glu@@ can by a doctor .
after a glu@@ cos@@ al injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose up@@ take ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the impact occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose concentration and with 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional rise in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like Human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a double as fast response as normal Human insulin and achieves the full glucose @-@ giving effect about 2 hours earlier than Human insulin .
from the data , it was obvious that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the meal begins compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
