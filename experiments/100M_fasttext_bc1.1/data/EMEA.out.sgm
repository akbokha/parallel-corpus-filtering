<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has judged the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the packaging supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. entertaining thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not available), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who are preparing difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the transmission of signals between brain cells by means of "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazl is believed to be" "" "partial agonic" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl acts like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with that of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg were significantly reduced in symptoms than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), nausea, somnolence (nausea), nausea, somnolence (nausea), nausea, somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and severe to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazl were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approved for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, even when treated with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no heightened risk of suicide with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolution, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including acrepute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify are treating signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazl had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% whereas the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' ('poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl results in extensive metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 incubators with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying treatment.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromorphine).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns created in animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against handling dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under a placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazl showed a generally lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was found in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under high-gloss therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% was in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse reactions reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazl showed high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the puttest in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Aberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ochre-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a effectiveness in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazl showed themselves superior to the prevention of a bipolar backwardness, mainly in the prevention of a regression into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and Hydroxylic of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination date is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolism of the metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor '(=' poor ') metabolism on CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="91">A review-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences concerning ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no importance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20-60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazl in Galle by monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1- to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at recommended clinical dose or between 16- and 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, hydroxy- Aripiprazl found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the Gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl injection solution and begin with oral application of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended to circumvent adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drug already used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazl, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melt tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations into the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with detoxification and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to an extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">The safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution is not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolution, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including acrepute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipates, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the segregation was greater compared to the single dose of Aripiprazl, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) were administered intramuscularly as intramuscularly as Lorazepam (2 mg dose).</seg>
<seg id="157">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying treatment.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the segregation was greater compared to the once-only gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than under a placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under a placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials with oral Aripiprazl (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was found in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The adverse reactions reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution with statistically significant significant improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggravation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of aggravation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance was observed because of reduced patient population.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger improvement than on haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an ochre-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazl showed superiority in the prevention of a bipolar backwardness, mainly in the prevention of a regression into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, Aripiprazl AUC is 90% bigger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg. intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there was no safety-relevant concern following maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazl in Galle by monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1- to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three-quarters of which had previously been an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 treated with Abraxane treated patients for treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer were no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy contraindications such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously had other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel containing pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in their blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that in patients with the first treatment, Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel containing medicines and that unlike other medicines, it does not have to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted to the company Abraxane BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathic grade 3 treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached at degrees 1 or 2, and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have other pharmacological characteristics other than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neutrophils increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly identified cardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease.</seg>

<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common) which can affect the traffic consistency and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated in the pivotal phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most distinctive haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactine hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphaggia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the jaw, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax, weakness of the muscles, back pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, sore throat, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no causal link established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules substance that promotes the pooling of microtubules from the tubular indigenes and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin imparts transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transeniendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminrezeptor and acts as paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the albumin protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two randomised unlinked studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastatic potential.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 Results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity over paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neuropathic grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous dosage of mamma cancer in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume refers to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft location of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane dosage (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on human liver microsome and tissue layers, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean for cumulative urine leakage was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available to patients at the age of more than 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarised medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with caution when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging inserts. • Designing the correct use of the product with a clear picture of the correct use of the product.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Absenamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if a blood donor is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Absenamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">Absenamed is injected into a vein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Absenamed was compared with injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before being either switched to Absenamed or continued to receive Eprex / Errypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Absenamed injected under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were switched to Absenamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Errypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients with Eprex / Eralp showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Absenamed is a rise in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Absenamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="377">Absenamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Absenamed has provided proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Errypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which manufactures Absenamed, will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued approval to the company Medice Drugs Pütter GmbH & Co. kg for the marketing of Absenamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">Absenamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml are used, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall burden; therefore, the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and disease status.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall burden; therefore, the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and disease status.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for control of anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticuloytic number to ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the amount of reproducibility of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticuloytic number to ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of reticuloytes by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserved foods is required, should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins - large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients undergoing treatment with any erythropoetin in erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive Absenamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastooplasty).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous crombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of carotitis or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of the haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reproducibility should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxidation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e., the Reticulocytes "Index"), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Absenamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropotic stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the use of epoetiins if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate progression of renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients under chemotherapy, an 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa dosage and the erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic occurrences (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment of the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take account of the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients foreseen for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia before the start of epoetin alfa drugs should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic procedure should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetin was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dosage should be adapted to increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial indemics, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), cerebral thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, aneurythromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascultic events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - general) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetins.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a particular value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you get regular dosages of Absenamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice weekly, distributed to two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your haemoglobin value does not exceed a particular value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia responds to treatment, the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">In order to ensure this and ensure that the haemoglobin value does not exceed a particular value, the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture as in the heart attack; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or injected into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (means against inflammation) shortly after the application of acetamol can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Paget, Aclaa may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclaa was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood was again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spine fractures in patients under Aclaa (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to patients under Aclaa (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those under placebo, the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclaa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclaa occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclaa must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to hydrofluoric acid or other bisphosphonates or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclaa are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclaa provides educational material to physicians who prescribe Aclaa to treat osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to use the medicine, and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out whenever they should consult the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contradication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclaa is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">Patients with low-traumatic hip fractures are recommended to administer the infusion of Aclaa two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclaa should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment with Aclaa, a long remission time was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium, twice a day, at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acetone infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetama.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclaa is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclaa are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclaa is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypocalzemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypocalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclaa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium, twice a day, at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene) should be considered before using bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclaa can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe adverse events reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclaa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of cioledron acid was associated with renal dysfunctions related to kidney function decline (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine clearance (measured each year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired kidney function were in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with acetonias compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with acetonia in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with acetonias in the morbus-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the morbus-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of citric acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoecrosis in the jaw area has been studied, especially in cancer patients, about osteoecrosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including cioledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteopathic arthritis in the jaw area in one patient with Aclaa and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypoglycemia, intravenous calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of acetone 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -1.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric spine fractures Aclaa decreased significantly over a period of three years and, after one year, the frequency of one or more new spine fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclaa-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% lower risk of spine fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclaa showed an unchanged effect over three years resulting in a reduction of 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effects on bone density (BMD) Aclaa increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hips by 6.0%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclaa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µg) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular layer of bone and the preservation of the trabecular mesoporosis in patients treated with Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5-mg dose of Aclaa reduced BSAP by 30% compared to baseline and was maintained at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with acetone compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclaa treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BMD at the total thigh and shank compared to all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months compared to placebo treatment, the Aclaa treatment led to an increase in the BMD by 5.4% at the total thigh and by 4.3% at the Schenkelheck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8,7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (Study CZOL446M2308) the once yearly administration of acetonium was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months in comparison with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclaa was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiological confirmed, particularly mild to moderate-weight morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the average age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronat once daily during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed in comparison with the baseline for Aclaa and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month main study (responding to therapy) could be included in the follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclaa and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was maintained in 141 of the patients treated with Risedronat, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat for an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of cioledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dossier independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the fast resorption into the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zinc-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased Clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because cioledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the cioledronic acid correlated with the creatinine clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction up to 35 ml / min does not require tin adaptation of the cioledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function disorder (creatine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is limited, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest single dose intravenous single dose for mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal tolerability of cioledronutrient in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage corresponding to the 6fold of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in trials involving repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed a teratogenicity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Cioledron Acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed by androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is structured unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclaa works by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving the bone its strength again.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Conception Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has judged the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylic agent or insulin, the present dose of sulfonylic or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonylic or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylic agent, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos increased the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of acetine for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylic acid showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c acid, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin received a reduction of the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available to use pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in cardiac insufficiency reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">Pioglitazone may not be used in patients with increased outcome of the liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the Liver Enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued should be guided by the clinical evaluation prior to the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be aggravated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who use pioglitazone as oral two-fold or threefold combination therapy with insulin or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch a reduction of visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thiazole-indione, including pioglitazone, a deterioration of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but killing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological clarification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 factures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment should be removed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is because, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal are reduced and the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone ALT anascents spread across three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl harnin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than in placebo, if Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) activated, which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce glucose production in the liver and increase the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for more than two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect has been added (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone the average HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials of one year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week-long study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, however, clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide reduced total plastic glycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under pioglitazone, whereas values reduced under metformin and Gliclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride levels and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereas the top concentrations on unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in feces (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicology studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is because, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal are reduced and the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased rates of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male and female rats) of the urinary epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazole-indione led to an increased frequency of colorectal tumors.</seg>

<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with prolonged lasting effects.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can perceive hypoglycemia-warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding starch, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA to insulin animal origin) may cause a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling several time zones, the patient should be advised to obtain advice from his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycaemia which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes care increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias may lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Actually - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints, which are called acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting may, however, be associated with a temporary degradation of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue Geleglass - Lipodystrophy At the injection point a lipodystrophy may arise, if missed to change the insertion points within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">Local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma on the injection site) may occur during insulin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Actually - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia may, however, develop gradually: • Early hypoglycemia can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape picking, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is achieved within 2 to 8 hours, and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Actraphane water bottle from the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before resuspended according to the operating instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="895">12 Likewise, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes care increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="896">13. an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting may, however, be associated with a temporary degradation of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminale half-life time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption as a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes in the bloodstream).</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular, patients with heart problems in prehistory may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering uric acid in the blood than allopurinol, but could also take a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already lead to primal deposits (including a rheumatic node known or currently present in the medical history and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum urine acid levels still exceed 2-4 weeks &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), a dose increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function restriction, efficacy and safety were not fully investigated (Cretan Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Since there is no experience in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplantation The use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnosuric medications, acute toxicity may occur during the course of the treatment because it is possible to mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the serum.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a deposition in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">During Phase 3 clinical trials, light abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the Febuxostator and in the further course depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas not carried out any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline (a inhibit of the metabolism of theophylin was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous dispensing of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Febuxostasis (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicine / indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with colchicin or indometacin, without a dose adaptation for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibiting effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that concurrent seizure containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed capture of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not cause side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatmodule compared to the Allopurinol group in pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal correlation with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic condition and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which (test-review) were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical studies no serious skin rashes or serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients have been treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients for up to 2 years, 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups overall more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient-years), according to indications.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous ECG, coughing, shortness of skin, skin tone, bursitis, protein uric, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in blood concentration in blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum urine acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum concentration of serum to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum concentration &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX-study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with renal function restriction (ie).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum concentration levels in subjects regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of serum supplementation of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the sustained reduction of serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic strokes (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the toxicity, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µg / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat were increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportionate.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronide is mainly caused by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in urine was found as unchanged Febuxostat (3%), acetonionid of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool was found as unchanged Febuxostat (12%), acetonionide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Specific patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change compared to normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean overall AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7.5 μ to 13.2 m / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (chill-buffer-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) liver function restriction, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not change significantly compared to normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">No significant changes were observed with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after intake of multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papilloma and carcinomas) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, at about 11-times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">In oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproduction of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 3 times the human exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied with a reduction in the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, which amounted to approximately 4,3 times and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13 times the human exposure, did not result in teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Tell your doctor before you start taking this drug, or if you have a heart weakness, or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you suffer from a high uric acid concentration as a result of a cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital disorder where too much uric acid is in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a stroke at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the gout attack is cleared before starting with the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be in any case, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, when you take ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a stroke or treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other drugs or have recently taken / applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use drugs that may be one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on the traffic consistency and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first eating of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with ADROVANCE (11%) compared to those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive organs such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), taped abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acidic crashing.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other components.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of chophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE is to be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, can only be given with special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients under the ingestion of alendronate (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible radiophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out, when symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphaggia, pain during swallowing or retrospecular pain or new or deteriorating heartburn to collect the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe chophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no heightened risk was detected, gastric and duodenalulcera (after market launch), among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly contain intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available that indicates whether the absorption of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring a jaw surgical intervention reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the pill the next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect absorption of alendronate if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for the use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients, but osteoporosis was also reported.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, compared to Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (e.g. by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraph is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood reflection requirements (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advance, the tacrolimus-level mirror should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients on Day 4.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus-Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after the transplant under Advagraph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, adapting the advance dose schema can last several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilisation after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - Liver Transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance Therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - If Prograf switch from Prograf must be converted from Prograf capsules twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, this conversion has to take place at ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advance once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplants In adult patients who are converted to a point of view, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advanced pancreatic and colorectal transplant patients, came to an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day for patients with pancreatic transplant patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Can adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients suffering from severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum, a calculation of the creatinine, and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to paragraph When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full-blood Tacrolimus-Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood flow levels of tacrolimus were also to be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advancf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or simultaneous use of substances which could change the whole blood circulation (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advance is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talks of Tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in formulation or regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be more effective compared to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarised formulation, Advagraph, are available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarised formula Advagraph are available.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during a treatment with Advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a cardiomyopathy was observed as cardiomyopathy which can therefore also occur under paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions by suitable clothes or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered states of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, a radiological examination should be (e.g.).</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with the same application of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain constant concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibit; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures must be taken particularly cautiously.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Because of its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high bond of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level should be mediated by the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosole protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies corresponded to the findings in the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multicenter study of oral Prograf was reported to over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>

<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enforced by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids are to be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, whereby excretion mainly occurs across the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advance was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (twice a day) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advance is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another drug called Recombinate in the European Union, but is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advance in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86% of 510 new hemorrhages with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advance (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Baxter AG for the marketing of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhages the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of the Factor VIII-plasmasher is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII pro kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should follow after the patient has been found, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, which is the greatest risk within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositional days and amnesia of well-known inhibitors, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-titrigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which showed a higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperatively day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with mild to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor was found after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the scope of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited awarded the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus" which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP inspected the company's responses to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP tag 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours presents benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that lawyers can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform CHMP whether the withdrawal would have consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents age 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is a tablet twice a day, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be followed on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy was the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than constipation of the nose, the patients who took aze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachycardia (heart chase), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (restlessness), somnolence (somnia), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to abloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular disease, hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk for an hemorrhagic attack.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is generally swallowed (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, liurid, cableolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and the data will not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headaches) must be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder carcinoma or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with haemoradin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with placebo and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken by loratadin alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness, which may result in an impairment of the traffic wickedness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the hibition of the expression of the P-Selectin gene on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight equation including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was found at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, receiving 414 patients with aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">During a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine on day 10 was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multiple dossier study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin badly mixed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional research on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, the pharmaceutical-vigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose, and conserving or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two trials in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by ascertaining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrangles, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials in Urticaria, the reduction of the symptoms after six weeks with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of loratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the case of persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with chloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking aserius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may be presumed that damage to traffic or ability to operate machinery may result.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side-effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with haemoradin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-phase clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the hibition of the expression of the P selectin molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">A statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered daily for 14 days at a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg a day (the neopfold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval revealed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurements of the flight equation including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology, is similar in different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited simply prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine infection is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrups at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistaminika was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the rate of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with haemoradin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patient demographics with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, a higher concentration of haemoradin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin in vivo did not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available that support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise dechloratadin and experience higher substance loading (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that metabolise restrictions is identical to that in children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose-absorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti-histamine therapy received a daily digestate dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the child population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied for over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrups at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger with blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multiple-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that are restricted.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company resumes its application for the transport of Aflunov to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread from humans to humans because people have not yet built immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to make antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign body), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine, in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA (EMEA) guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years associated with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of having the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not cure can, however, delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of associated infection and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults who were previously not treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was fortified with low dose kritonavir, was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used earlier proteinase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or changing viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine used with ritonavir extracts the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, it came under Agenerase along with ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued to take up their former proteinase inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amonavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are broken down just as axially and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As in other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (alterations in the body fat distribution), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years, the risks outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic Ritonavir amplifier, but the Committee noted that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the marketing of asgenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase should be taken to pharmacokinetic boosting of amponavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amonavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ammonium as a solution to intake is 14% less than Ambelavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable for one milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amonavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to absence of data on safety and efficacy (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should take care of patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and are also the substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzel 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir during the intake of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medications (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver irregularities with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of conjunctiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic cortical-eroid effects including Cushing Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiate removal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be canceled in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, whose therapy needed medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV condition and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and are also the substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzel 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose agents are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amonavir which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels with a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects were often observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amponavir can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already received Johanniskraut, the amonavirus ring and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required if cloves are administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax on the other hand 30% lower, if ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was given in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amonavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower, if Ambelavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amonavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambelavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to observe closely meshed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosine in combination with Didanosin, but it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ammonium (600 mg twice a day) and ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advisable since Delavirdine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amonavir and ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dispensing of amonavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in the side-effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in dosage of Rifabutin must be at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) on the 2.69xfold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous application of fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can possibly result in interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids cannot be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it may lead to resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulcants which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and Verapamil can be increased by amponavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluorozone propionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensing of asgenerase with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected at the same time when Agenerase is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amponavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be used along with orally biased midazolam (see section 4.3) while simultaneous use of asgenerase with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiate removal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the dose if Ambelavir is administered with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous application of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amonavir-related substances have been detected in the milk lactating rats, but it is not known whether amponavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the colonisation to the uterus to the end of the downtime amonavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breast feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not impaired by the administration of amonavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are associated with the use of asgenerase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsokovic fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Less than 113 antiretroviral, non-pretreated people treated with amonavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bull's eyes) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients had 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes usually were mild to moderate, erythematous or makulogivenous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients receiving agenerase along with low dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amonavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinfeeds with the result of an education of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of amonavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmite Concentration (IC50) of Ambelavir is in the range between 0,012 and 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amonavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral, non-treated patients with the currently approved fosamprenavir / ritonavir-dosages, the mutations described in other ritonavir were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral, non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosonavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the Isolate of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I84V, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of fosamprenavir / 100 mg kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following Proteasehammer-mutations occurred:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I84V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amponavir associated genetic samples produces a certain cross-resistance to ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between Ambelavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossiamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral and non-retroviral patients, in which a fosamprenavirus inhaled pattern (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), cavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), cavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), cavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates) and tipranavir / ritonavir (four out of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Ambelavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitors-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a promising therapy is recommended in order to prevent the accumulation of numerous mutations within limits which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which adults treated with PI treat virological failure (600 mg twice daily) and nucleoavialaloga (NRTI) or standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly associated with low dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-supremacy threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children between the ages of 2 and 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included in the study had plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of amonavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the concurrent intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change results in a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amber which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound ammonia remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of asgenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily prenatal exposure, as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amonavir is out of solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase's solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amonavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amonavir in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas were encountered in male animals, which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there is little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes contained, amber was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of egenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control rooms and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic exposure to plasma, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosages in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus navigation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concurrent use should take care of patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances.</seg>

<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amonavir which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, for Cmax on the other hand 30% lower, if ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was given in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amonavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambelavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to observe closely meshed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amonavir and ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and verapamil can be increased by amponavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluorozone propionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Concurrent administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Ambelavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">Antiviral activity of amonavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmite Concentration (IC50) of Ambelavir is in the range between 0,012 and 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Ambelavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitors-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the potential benefits of "unbiased" asgenerase should be taken into account when optimizing the therapy with PI-pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound ammonia remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2198">After the regeneration of the treated skin, the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed approximately 12 weeks after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data about long-term recovery rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent or pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumors (&gt; 7,25 cm2) there is a lesser likelihood of responding to iroquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lipstick area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data about the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratocosos in anatomical places outside the face and scalp are available.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data about the actinical keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with iroquimiine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, iroquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were obtained neither after one-time or repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod cream in related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream pertaining to side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The reported side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, than likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream in relation to side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects listed by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials associated with Imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This review of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with three times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream, it often came to local skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excrement / declining / scaling (23%) and oedema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often severe erytales (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe decomposition and salutation (19%) came.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral recording of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of iroquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy in relation to complete curing of the genital warts during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod patients cured completely; this was in 20% of the 105 with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic ac- lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the uneasable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications outside warts, actin keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not usually arise in paediatric patients and therefore were not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated semi-evaluation period was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased milz-weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected, a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the cream-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not mined and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduced lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with resuscitation equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in urine and related to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme reduced GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60% and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic response).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review and update all new information that may be known each year.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will see patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovarian of Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any related side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where revitalization facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer period of interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of treatment, caution must be handled cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 study and their extension to a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and obverse oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Interaction related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a seroconversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of seroconfluence during the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 trial (or to early excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect antibodies (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never been too seroconfluence.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the gamma-mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or decrease of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even though adverse drug reactions were typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzyme replacement therapy lie in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulate substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of anticipated FeV and the total distance in the 6 minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme had an improvement in lung function and viability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decline in the GAG level was observed in the urine (µg / mg creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in week 22 during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of progression (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe form-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG level in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided that the dilution was performed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • According to the body weight of each patient, first determine the number of thinned penetrates.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the dose of cisplatin, an anti-wrinkle treatment (anti-vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood cell changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, removed or the dose is decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural roots, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cell proliferation showed longer survival times than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each penetrating bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is available in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for overwiev-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with choroidal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the emetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">The reduction of frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given a corticosteroid in the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive telemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate-transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood cell or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recuperation, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2, and 3 treated for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient returns the value before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose-inductions an hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Level 3 or 4 occurs or as a result of the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients at age 65, or over the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 times the upper Biliary limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in immunosuppression and may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils again reach a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity as seen in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beamed if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with emetremixed need to be used as a prophylactic measure to reduce untreated toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent consumption of nonsteroidal antiphloistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom a therapy with Pemetrexed is intended, must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in transverscellular space drainage of the effusion will be considered before the telemetric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed, if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible degradation of the reproductive capacity by means of telemetrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal antiphloistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to reduced telemetric elimination with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available regarding the interaction potential of NSAIDs with long half-life such as Pirox xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of emetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, must be avoided at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetre-.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy required an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">No data is available for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by means of telemetrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm reservation process before the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemeters are transferred to breast milk and undesirable effects in the nursing infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, and 163 patients with mesothelioma received randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency information: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the available data of spontaneous reports).</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies show that telemetretaining acts as an antifolate with multiple targets by blocking the thyme synthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit of survival compared to those patients who were simply bundled with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investigational medication (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the sole carcinoma arm (218 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly patients and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Supersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normal ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of unspecified size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can cause anxiety with regard to potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lilagging properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of gastric and pancreatic lipients.</seg>
<seg id="2536">It was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaltionally low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg - 3,5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline €3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline: 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients administered with a minimal systemic resorbitive dose, M1 (M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after cleavage of the N-shaped leucine group), which represented approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies that are powerful trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies that are moderate for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemary).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alois was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with alopic in the 24 hours after chemotherapy did not vomit (132 of 223) versus 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with alopic showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) versus 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in excessively emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Alois to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of palon osetron with medicines that lengthen the QT interval or in patients with the QT interval prolonged or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicine) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">The use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (altogether 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxixi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and administration reactions (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an analoxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life 7.2 hours) were given that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazron and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies of moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were compared to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and daggers.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical research, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of endogenous palon osetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous administration a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportionally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg for healthy individuals and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was increased at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was equal to 3 consecutive days, the total score (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to a single intravenous dose of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the introduction of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found in the urine of 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The overall length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination date and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum human exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 In preclinical studies, indications have shown that palonosetron can only block ionic channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary gland, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is intended for one-time application, the relevance of these results as for humans is low.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of the prescription for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damages, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood abnormally.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon has presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medical device to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar to the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease rose again in more patients than with reference medicines; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was used to examine the question to what extent the drug dissolves an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (skin infections associated with crust formation) and small infirmists (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon might not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"" "119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under" "" "Altargo" "" "and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment the treatment is canceled, the ointment should be carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effects of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface have not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations in humans after topical application on scrubbed skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax under topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment increased by 81% on scrubbed skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are insufficient in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin iointment should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding continues or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used, the most common reported side-effect irritation was at the site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passtagerianus (formerly pleurotus passwort).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s of ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin appear harmless at least some types of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-responding to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the final application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to people following topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 Sized skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 screened skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical-vigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market undertakes to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmaceuvigilance activities in the pharmaceutical sector, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next periodic safety update report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed to you by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines help to "teach" the immune system (the natural defences of the body) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambienza contains the same components as the Vaccine, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997, has been approved for the Vaccine children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinet adults and Twinet children are administered in the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as a receipt for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambirix's protection was similar to six months and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two doses, whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is required for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination need a booster as protection, as they may be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is achieved, so that the administration of further vaccines may be necessary in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal result in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix may, however, be injected by subcutaneous injection, as it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mask mumps-Rötel vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier Thirty and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness based on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated using the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matchiness was comparable high per volume (i.e. over the entire inoculation cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambience compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and intensity was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old Vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of inoculations that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 according to the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme containing Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formally inactivated hepatic A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months inoculation scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered in the second year at the same time with the booster drop of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mason-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the present formulation as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes either before or after resuspening.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines Ambiani can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been concluded with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses of vaccines (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly obtain a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per accent (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection against the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambientrix is injected by people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defense or if you / your child is undergoing a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the granting of the first approval for the placing of the market, the CHMP has argued that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammountis can also be used in patients aged over one month with incompletely enzymatic enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammountaps - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomacherlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammoons could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudontic medication, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammoose can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste sa-, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents excessive ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "due to the rarity of the illness at the time of approval, only limited information on this medicine was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delay manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first life-month) there is an indication for use when anamnesis consists of hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disturbances AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinleuscarylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty in swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and demorming.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least an adverse event (AE) occurred at 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypoglycaemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms come with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that containing sodium phenylbutyrat of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine is produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infaust, and the disease even led to death in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the utilization of alternative ways of excretion of nitrogen (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartum (however, within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delay manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithinleuscarylase deficiency) treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism, and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous dosage of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, the plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingestation.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycleus disorders or haemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma the next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma seal were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had not been treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinleuscarylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, in accordance with 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), there were lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactacidosis, severe hypoglycaemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that containing sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, the plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingestation.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure includes a small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with varying strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress uplift" (an anomalous measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in allways or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often used as a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as mab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the GPI's ability to prevent new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivaliruine, other hirudine or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (IA / NSTEMI), an emergency intervention or an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous rate of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed further, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before surgery a bolt can be administered of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an exclusive Bolus Gift of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT is shortened after 5 minutes) to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully blended prior to application and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT attaches more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients suffering from severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second intake of 0.3 mg / kg can be administered and the ACT is checked again 5 minutes after the second bolus dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the bivalirudin-bolus was administered with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unfractional lifting parin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with a different anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most bleedings of arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, in patients who undergo a percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI), bleeding can occur throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin reaches the level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocytic or thrombocytic aggregate), these agents may increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In each case, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters can be checked regularly in the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregate or anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleedings as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding associated with Bivalirudin alone were significantly less frequent than in the groups with haparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood vessel, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood-localisations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angioxin contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and in the anion bindings region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thrombosis, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin had no thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study unquestionable heparin or esnoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the angiography (at the time of randomization) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients undergoing a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1- year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-day and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>

<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding both in the ACUITY and the timo scale up to day 30 for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol is shown in table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel total population (ITT) according to protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival UFH / Enox Bival Bival UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + alone + + GPIIb / IIIa (N = 4603) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl without apparent bleeding centre, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood vessel, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients receiving a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide enters into its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is performed in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-cases of the clinical steady-state plasma concentrations) was limited to surpassed pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events due to a longer-term physiological stress in response to non-homeopathic coagulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even with very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose pike bottles made of type 1 glass to 10 ml, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a water bottle Angiox and lightly swiveled until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 5% glucosal solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) Sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of Bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or given as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose (sugars) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter exposure times than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin logic.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra versus 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH for the marketing of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 inadequate dosing or abortion of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-related diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin which is used and can therefore change in the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamin oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympathetic drugs such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin occurs neither in breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the undesirable drug reactions known from clinical trials are listed, grouped by system classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous glucan by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucosal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake (in particular by skeletal muscle and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the impact occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose concentration and with 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional rise in the glucosal effect, just like Human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a double as fast response as normal Human insulin and achieves the full glucose-giving effect about 2 hours earlier than Human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was obvious that a similar postprandiale glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">A better postprandiale control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved such as with a human normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulisin in 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the meal begins compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
