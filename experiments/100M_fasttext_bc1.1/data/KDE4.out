the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to access .
further information on using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings ... Open the Card Tools tab and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setup modules from the node ; add@@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras shut@@ down . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M tree of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of graphi@@ cally representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have reasonable color and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle which is switched over view color mode can either be a depth for easy recognition of the depth of the ne@@ sting or the mapping of another file property , such as name , owner , group , or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space available to display , or if the area of child rectang@@ les should be displayed ( whereby therefore representation errors can be caused by constraints on the mark of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
with presentation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the child &apos;s sub @-@ entries is left to the implementation . here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rectang@@ les are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive double division .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View View on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you access the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field .
the option Images for each line has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
using the box file name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the View box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the image size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders will be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page should be saved .
you can use the check box to set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy the original pictures to the gallery to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file check@@ box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings offers you easy access to the general &amp; HTML settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can view the media playback for the navigation area in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the Navigation Pan@@ e window or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
changing browser recognition adds a menu item in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the mapping in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
with the menu entry ... you can set the size of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; Edit . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ phot@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; Edit ; try to make the notification of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser displays a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to answer you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , you may ask questions to other users of &amp; edited here . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site to learn news about releases released and other information about &amp; edited .
the best start to participate &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for registering in the developer mailing list of &amp; edited ; .
when you move &amp; edited ; for the first time , you will be asked where to save your pictures and your database . simply enter path names , or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data dump is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; Edit ; you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as base folder . &amp; Edit ; look at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; Edit ; dur@@ ance recur@@ sively the library path across its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to paste extra @-@ bs &amp; Edit by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ do have no photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can lock in &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Melo@@ dies to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it may also work with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu aid menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; Edit . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ phot@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is frequently used as a USB mass storage device .
digital cameras which support an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to hosts and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common module structure for &amp; edited ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; edited ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; Edit ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that you can not store a picture in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name will only work if this is shown in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; edited are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Features or the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the album &apos;s properties .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose to scan an album Import Image . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by Date with View Albums By Date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; Edit , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and click on the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports input of keywords for single photos in the My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change over settings ; set up the Albums tab here and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows appearing when you leave the mouse poin@@ ter at a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such help window .
photos are all you edited and edited . albums and keywords enable you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view and change your photos .
it can happen that &amp; Edit ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata that appears in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . by doing so , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to right @-@ click on the preview and rotate it . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; edited , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; Edit ; use the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view , so you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ fes@@ aver ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the image &apos;s IP@@ TC data fields , at least for JPEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , it will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by right @-@ clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select As a album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and assign them from the context menu keyword .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made , etc .
once you have tagged a photo , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
in addition to the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search finds matches . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after you have saved it , it appears in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search is done . the results will be displayed in My Search list in the main window . the Text box Save search as is used to add a name to My Search list to your request . if you want to change your selection once again , select the respective entry from the list My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select a search , the search form will appear again with the search information entered before . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . here are more rules for searching . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; Edit ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are automatically added , separated by operators , added . an option can be added to this list with the Find Group / Search group . each option can be added to this list with the Find File / Search group . each option can be combined with other information on the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a Schw@@ ell@@ erts the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the unused search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; find the suitable pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added to the list below for later use . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; Edit ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add to the illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; Edit ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Tools .
from the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you choose to synchron@@ ize thumb@@ nails from the toolbar and execute zoo and move operations on one of the images , then they are also executed with the other picture . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly out of the lighting table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the picture you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode Pre@@ view both pictures will show the same image area .
just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photographs again . we focus on the processes for digital photographers which &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , re@@ viewing , group@@ ing , saving , evaluating , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer inventory management to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer .
you might be happy with this structure . they can be quickly found across your location , unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; Edit . this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? &amp; Edit ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often refer to other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import Cat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded keywords , then it will be &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are followed .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want to share your photos with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you begin to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motif that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for oneself alone .
with &amp; Edit ; you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of utilizing ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by using pictures with geographic data . &amp; Edit ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights in order to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is an endor@@ sement of the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photograph is a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers you the picture to others . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change these metadata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; in the near future , such a module is available for batch processing .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ al prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these losses are the same that can happen to you on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which are reasons for data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be treated carefully and you may no longer trust you than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even when they are just written . this is why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called is@@ o@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the Format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in an un@@ appropri@@ ated format . then read the data back to check you . also , do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
in short , Dis@@ ks hold the longest if you are operated at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temperature , the error rate increases dramatically . S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s electronic parts are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can &apos;t determine this error . this is especially read errors and publishing counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter a lot , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ oves the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug connector , but remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage prot@@ ectors which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it therefore makes sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember to tr@@ ine all cables before going on holiday .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you do not have any protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate inter@@ ferences in the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the number of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical fron@@ tiers . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . so , backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster hits local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as said above , a common reason for data loss despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ driven FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option than to be compatible with the current system . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the entry if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can store images in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and is bound to use metadata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in raw format . however , X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on an architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ table , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited . in the Adding a Photos to an Album , you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect these to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it will try to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not provide preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; Edit ; or editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; edited ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the Del@@ ete button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New to download is available . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums tab . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums tab . then select the Album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only a few , then you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully taken into a &amp; edited , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can cause dup@@ licate filen@@ ames if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filen@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day automatically .
the first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard auto identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new filen@@ ame , which &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can use this to automatically upload sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar Met@@ a data , you can read which information your camera could have embedded into the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; edited ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ verb@@ s at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want to upload and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that is indicated in length and width graph@@ s and can be displayed on a map . the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ones , and map references ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , through a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last but not least via manual input of known locations .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for Windows and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool . it uses the signs of ha@@ unted coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com doesn &apos;t show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Edit ; try to give as much control over its working processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; Edit . to access these settings , you need to change settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set on saved preview or editing image processing . you can therefore set the default behavior of &amp; Edit ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the relevant IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected from the camera interface when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s foot@@ er : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be names such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description to the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image other &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the respective IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; Edit ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; Edit without being lost .
save images as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor in the main window rests over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code formats are attempted , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one or edited ; album folder that has none of these extensions , edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
the settings of the illuminated display of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the light table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one then you can obtain better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting Los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ prone placement , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; Edit , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option traces the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to catch the sh@@ rou@@ d , as continuous white . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the Edit &amp; Edit image options . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data , which come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color frame construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can place the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dation correction as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information such as the color information of a color space in the other is to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture opens in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Sets the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; Edit ; examine these folders then during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be compatible with the camera operator and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color @-@ tone @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , the cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated . this could be done manually rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface you can &amp; Edit ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will be loaded by &amp; Edit . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Adju@@ st@@ ment Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained through the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during ad .
the camera properties on the left show a list of all supported cameras at the time . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / mask on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn it on .
check whether &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu C@@ ameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash@@ can ads , you can edit &amp; edit the conversation ; you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photo and delete an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; Edit ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , otherwise you will need to apply the changes using the Change button .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; Edit at startup . this will ha@@ sten the start process of &amp; Edit ; .
searching for new photos urged &amp; edited ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; Edit ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , the Edit &amp; Edit menu will prompt ; see if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; Edit , to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; edited , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes a fast image processing with some base tools . you can use it to view your photos and edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry View / Edit .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ c@@ e.@@ For more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Up Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current filen@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rec@@ over button from the File menu or using the button The Rec@@ over of Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by Edit Back@@ path or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and mem@@ ori@@ ze C@@ trl ; Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in in the photo and zoom out by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you can enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Options dialog by &amp; Edit . you can view it from the Edit menu ; see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default and k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . entire image template pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select the Print Assistant from the Album Export . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; Edit ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
in the let@@ tering view you can insert or insert let@@ tering with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label panel in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme ranging from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either by one mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 keyboard short@@ cuts . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always applied to one image . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC Re@@ gency . the code will follow the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in the Edit &amp; Edit menu .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can thus quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved to the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword to the keyword , please read the keyword keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed on the main window . normally , the left side bar with their Album , Date , Key@@ word and Search is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created key words are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it to the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter stands on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in settings different .
if you have a rule with and created and note that it has to be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; edited ; s specific implementation .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is based on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are per email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Spring@@ blo@@ oms and click Info and then click Info About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB means that your monitor is s@@ RGB , then you must either turn your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , adjust , automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the brightness values over the entire image , allowing the dark@@ est point to be black and the brigh@@ test spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
lev@@ elling : this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ sting of all values in between .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photograph .
the white balance correction is a bit limited because there is a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can go too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Col@@ ors White Balance of Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target picture . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ n with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photograph as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depths for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this encoding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under Col@@ ors Sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you will always need the same correction . you will find more information in the manual for sound value correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by expos@@ ing a partially developed pressure to a short flash and followed the development of the image . the result was a partial neg@@ ative of the image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s highly saturated colors are too much for some photographers , especially those who do not have any landscapes .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . any changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool value correction is based on improving the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and to make sure the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the image &apos;s settings . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to select whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most useful . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the highest for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values as inter@@ actively as with the input values . compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shades , means and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a cam component to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels get dark@@ er .
if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo fixed in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mixer of the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you maintain lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the Mon@@ och@@ rome effect , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ oph@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the sh@@ aw@@ l tones . this is very similar to the process of absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; Edit ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed below ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame adding can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame add the module from image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . passing through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you cut the tool according to the aspect ratio before .
with this convenient tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template can apply a template over a picture .
the menu image template apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , simply send an email in English to the Edit menu ; edited @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
below you can see three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . use the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works more psych@@ ometric . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a depth filter even while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you get the control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to call correc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
however , you should handle it carefully as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image intensi@@ fies the tool . under re@@ focusing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image sof@@ tly , and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect .
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ alizes a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to reverse a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filters . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus generally reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing color re@@ focusing in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which leads to that the mathematical result also depends on the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : increasing the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring gauge is wrong . in most cases , use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red stit@@ ching used a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob regul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink will allow an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undes@@ ired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail capture p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and make details sharp . note that a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the depth of detail should always be subordin@@ ate to direction dependen@@ cy .
direction dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value near 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD has@@ hing , a high value may produce wavel@@ similar patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step@@ width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . be careful that small angles produce a long runtime . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ al step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more in quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor , but it dou@@ bles the running time . we therefore recommend it to skip it .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied to a photograph taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ pane details and the Advanced Settings sub @-@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance to the front of the filter to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and the noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark@@ er areas , which are typically more corro@@ ded .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it can be too high . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ tly use the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well suited to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local faults that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Load make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ en .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old colour photo , which was read by a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug tool Hot@@ pixels allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous paragraph , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the Wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixels correction on a color photo , seen from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , in particular those in the medium and large photo format , can often not even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the edges and edges of the image by allowing the light to reach the sensor there .
but it also has disadvantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which may increase the required sh@@ utter time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as there are otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a image that has been done without this filter . the vig@@ net@@ ting correction tool applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further controls of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reducing it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the controls only provide positive values , because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target picture , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ der handles the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion .
this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the reverse character of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction of the first gra@@ ding . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a tone @-@ shaped correction , the effect would seem obvious to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the C@@ utting Tool from the Edit Pan@@ e Cut from image processing or via the Zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters setting film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add movie gran@@ ule option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mixes ink channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver particles of photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film additive effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that used the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal graph . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to sketch you .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Zoom : blur@@ ts the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : camera shooting from a car or train .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the ink tank in the picture and wi@@ pes out these without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the Stop button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the Edit Translation or Transform@@ ers mirr@@ oring .
photography infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change sizes in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
the tool for res@@ izing is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try to blow up the tool .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this . enlarge any st@@ aging for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ en .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been magni@@ fied to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear expansion by comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rectangle . you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file saving file or save file from the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the max ratio button to set the range to the maximum possible depending on the ratio and orientation chosen .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the fixing help make it possible to hide Help in order to better compile your pictures . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will give you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ hand gel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this kind .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the above mentioned golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way , you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ c@@ ted ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . now , move the mouse into the image preview to position the two lines . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . but be aware of the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new Hei@@ ght : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
adjust your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two certific@@ ations are twice as much blur@@ red and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
&amp; Edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; Edit ; only displays files in formats you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change the file in the image editing . you can change this list of file extensions that are edited and edited . see the Configuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . see the Configuration section for more information on how to use modules with &amp; Edit .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; is no film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies .

many tools you need to carry out the photo processing are in &amp; Edit ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture Application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontally divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower one compared to the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and drop it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Charac@@ ter@@ istics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either be applied to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the Palette toolbar , you can select from a list of installed trays or browse folders to files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the Pal@@ let View . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
the color is described below the Pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selection . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Ad@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected , you can set this mode by selecting the Over@@ write in the Select C@@ ursor .
a selection which was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a poin@@ ter character , if another color follows . if there are therefore three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program included , and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated and represented in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in one &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar can only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog window .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Set@@ ting c@@ viewer ; see also .
if you open a graph@@ ene file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; file , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
with the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed across several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is requested .
the session administration page gives you the option to set the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) the files of the last session or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm calcul@@ ates the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ back model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
der &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that will then run from a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ene file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms can also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directional or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
show the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ cursor , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file chan@@ gelo@@ g in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it requires the following programs :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the tool@@ box for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been changed you will be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears where you can choose to create the icon from a template , or if you want to restart from scratch .
returns the last und@@ o step . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
add the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the icon range of gray scales .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the dot you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
add the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol grid .
with the Add ... , Edit ... and Remove button , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel In@@ sert or Display Lin@@ e@@ ale and set a colored : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparency display . you can also set the ch@@ ess@@ board size : the car@@ os on small , Medium and Great as well as Color 1 : and Color 2 : choose .
using the K@@ IP@@ I module , tools are available to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you need to have installed k@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e .
when you scan the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image . see the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the Scan button , wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select the folder and # 160 ; you must also select or create the image by saving the image .
screen photos can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot is made , the dialog box options appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , present your camera &apos;s photos online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of creating a token . it is used for your authentication . so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access author@@ is@@ ations that the module displays . at the moment the module does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ li@@ ly options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image &apos;s metadata . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to perform a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data taken at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera tim@@ e@@ zone here .
the setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below this , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference options can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button Cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box displays the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Ad@@ just this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ bition tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to ensure the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab sel@@ ector allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed in a hierarch@@ ical way . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below will show the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the App@@ ear@@ ance App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image creates a page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ ity Show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ XLS , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures .
with Other color depth you can change the default color depth , which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail preview window allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred while generating . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . in addition , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please see exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ as@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ as@@ au .
the images you select are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the image or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG export file . keep the extension mp@@ g as far as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your needs , you can start encoding the movie with the code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings icon at the bottom .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for white balance should be used . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can later edit the image .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG version can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently , or otherwise use the JPEG format , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use canc@@ eling .
batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the option to over@@ ride existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change in size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to screen size .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you selected . click the Add Images button to add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button Images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
pay attention not to sending many pictures at one time . most email accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time you change them .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button C@@ lose , you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ as@@ au module , a window with questions like your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option allows the file name of the images to be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop .
the option images random@@ ly choose to indicate that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
a delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 milli@@ seconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , now in each group , thus in people , locations and in the group keywords are entries .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you click on the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see the picture .
selecting another person will only show the images on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the image below .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . please note that you can display the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must select which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you will need to select the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the View window , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the View Window you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut .
when you access the search in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you want to enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are scanned according to this text . if you want , you can also enter a date by which you want to be searched ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. , in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick Rel@@ ation , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; Get photo album ; and in the first dialog select the demo , if you want &amp; k@@ not album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can test the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create from the File menu ...
before creating HTML pages you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout , and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ not album ; export file should be created that is visible on the overview page .
last but not least , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information being displayed to the viewer without any description . for example , all images are exported from a party . you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not need to download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . for the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these settings , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a great deal of time doing the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
in the Manual operation near the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copied image near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want to , just select the Export Data option .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size limit . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu Import ... , the exported database will be imported as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category Per@@ sons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside several picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will follow the various steps of ( 1 ) set the information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal Backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and will automatically re@@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the various settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as explained in .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the Mod@@ ules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the Demo Database before using them on your own images . don &apos;t say I would have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications categ@@ ori@@ ze their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules to make use of the features with &amp; k@@ photo album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Per@@ sons , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ not album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not include much information , as you don &apos;t have any information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the image has been taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text field by specifying persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : if you have a family celebration for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , you can see that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and arrange them more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical list , click on the sorting icon on the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image separately , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image on the top right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a header . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Not@@ ebook , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry into a category and drop it to a sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a box by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button , which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then pop up the window . see this process in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have not set any filters . an example can be found here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , images can also be used without you saved to the disk . in the picture you will need to record the pictures somewhere to record &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut is not saved to the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again . so if you want to avoid getting rid of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all images on it .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to see your little sister can control and click to lock the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view .
this allows you to set which images are to be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to block images , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures back , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , everyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to block the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours doing it is natural that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , you have a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see them . of course , it shows the image , but additional information that you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and down the picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse . by using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the plus button in the middle of the image .
with the Point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the power button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work for videos that are in and out are the plus and minus key .
you can turn the image with the script functions from the context menu . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the inter@@ rupt and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so you can see them in the browser . so if you want to edit , print or whatever you selected , just copy them all at once . this is described in detail . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you let categories display in a particular preview screen , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your gem@@ old later .
in order to activate the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select View on the image from the context menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eti@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Create menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu is displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can invo@@ ke the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Properties view .
press Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered as default . if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the Visi@@ bility Level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility stage chosen in the toolbar .
the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them in any way . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of the view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the Anf@@ al bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... Save . a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aro@@ id ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene ren@@ ders .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or gra@@ dient effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard one adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method is adaptive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again , because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray each pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , a grid of 4 pixels will be calculated by tracking a specific incre@@ ment of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
ten percent of the population of the population ( b 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and examined for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated rays have not encountered any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eti@@ er ; not yet the full command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aro@@ e ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation of the displayed object . set here the path to your retention and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate .
you can set the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you cross high detail accuracy for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you activate channel smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender mode section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window orders section , explain how to create and store window orders .
the standard window arrangement field : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tabs you get a card map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aro@@ id ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you create . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree instantly change according to these settings . as a result , you can see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a squ@@ ad ( insert the final body Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this problem .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eti@@ er ; it actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited final level . if you render the scene , the level stretches as far as the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to practice one unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Dis@@ placement and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the pigment only shows a matte black material , because you still have to enter the pigment changes . therefore , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the ro@@ ader and the sphere in the preview , click on the Apply button and then open the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ color . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the check@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
always color mon@@ och@@ rome in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be easily created as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball pigment , then select Uni@@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or hit the Enter key .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eti@@ er offers ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . so the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Back@@ paths .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find Options for Set@@ ting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set pre @-@ set short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aro@@ ids ; change commands or add new ones .

a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture mapping .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic shapes . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; quot ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set if any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field will appear in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Set Up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show dialog , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; quot ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; quot ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; quot ; set up that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the scroll bar or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut keys for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .

in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . sk@@ ill@@ ings should display the colors with what you should indicate in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure to indicate a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , giving you important information and actions on the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes scanning and veri@@ fying images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE projection page by entering the required information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; using the command can@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the full preview fits in the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select how &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; images store . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save As option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically generated images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is added up each time a picture is stored . the # # # character string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help launches the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; .

below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking on the player window and setting up global short@@ cuts ... Click with the right mouse button in the player window and select Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... select .
you may set up any existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . by doing so , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . thus , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be inv@@ oked relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change Sign@@ als that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the unit ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le includes the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry has been cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , e.g. , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as .@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ cat@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as the Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cat@@ ch@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and Quick Find , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose to listen to your music . these and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !

with the choice of Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection for foreground and background color .
continue playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the color selection dialog . if you do not use colors , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Option Screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also enable further setting options in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse to music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the selected as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the Play@@ list browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l window is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is reachable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card@@ boards last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and then update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call up similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in context browsers . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok just needs the k@@ deli@@ b package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to e.g. find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading Met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes while editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the email will automatically open when a crash happens ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be repaired .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / repetition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times , until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ co app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ co app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which cat@@ ag@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ lo@@ sive Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are easiest due to the help of an expert to find your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . please use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it down exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you will find the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably you lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ L ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are included ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 box , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different link ( e.g. , sink sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people , if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
for K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ br@@ andt _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the less beams react the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let &apos;s run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current title when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ boot , Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window that can be changed in size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button turns a piece into the queue in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that is not matched with the short @-@ term intention of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the General Settings .

if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you will need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re @-@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed in addition to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the present is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up the Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
r@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . of course , you are welcome to take this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , has several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window there is a running text displaying the current play or the current stream . just below is the area , the play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the play .
in addition , the Player window includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , magni@@ fic@@ able window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included in the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre @-@ settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the Main Menu or click on the E@@ Q in the Player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use but still powerful enough even for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub @-@ window has started . the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you will see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
in order to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then choose from the context menu one of the options to add a piece or album to the playlist .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you do not yet run a text script , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , and no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the current play ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by artist and there will be a further division according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Arti@@ sts .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ts to artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums in your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will be sorted first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ track your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , it might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the tool bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Ad@@ just the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to media players - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the media player . see the Media Player browser section for more details .
all pieces of this artist burn / Burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the garbage bin@@ s ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various artists .
canc@@ eling compilation @-@ marking - Chan@@ ges a record selected as a composition back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown under Various Arti@@ sts , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by artist in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply .
under the toolbar , there is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick music from a given URL . for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , holding down the Shift key will be helpful : as a result , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter words separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all keywords . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is what Mike Old@@ field is looking for , but not for entries , such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : - something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add to add playlist to the playlist . to the right , you will find Play@@ list , Emp@@ ty Play@@ list and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons will pop @-@ up and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer is located in the middle of the toolbar . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as what you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by double clicking the mouse into the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist .
clicking on this entry opens the Visu@@ alization Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection Browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ defined ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio libraries ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with that dynamic playlist .
double @-@ click on the playlist , drag it to the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly . the play@@ lists Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ eces starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first play .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist will open the dialog for editing the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist right here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not dup@@ licate a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed , taking into account the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , you will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; script by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also fetch new scripts directly from the Internet .

this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other low @-@ loss compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ code to MP3 , you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you will now see a dialog box that looks like this :

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without normal@@ isation , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
when a project changes and has not yet been saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . also , you can stop closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will prompt you for any project that is not saved , as would you have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called File closure .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can be opened only if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described about the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project .
this allows you to copy a CD onto another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
the DVD Copy dialog opens , allowing you to copy a DVD to another medium without the need for a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the content completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used single @-@ standing . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black borders .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locks and un@@ locking the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Table of Cont@@ ents allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ board is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the keyboard assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial , which of the accompanying programs will give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the command line functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void f@@ os@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can create a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Sel@@ id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT smooth / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; audio CD ; it can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many encoding that enco@@ des these wa@@ v files by default ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , selecting the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if it is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything by themselves . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction to encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading out a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , all being manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you can find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB query of the CD data according to the setup of request on the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start the reading and - if an En@@ co@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default . it should be noted that the encoder in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ cks ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the Main Setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , differences become less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless delivered with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting usually should provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . well enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps compression rate . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . well enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio approximately 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ cht@@ e@@ o@@ equipment . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed with &amp; audio creator ; and create the encoding program to create folder and file names and the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button lab@@ eling in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can upload information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of Pi@@ eces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( translated by the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only be the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when &amp; audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the next underlying mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save songs from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if it has not yet been done .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . on the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab themselves .
the encoder package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading pi@@ cker on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ n@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are still uncertain about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg ; trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creator of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; something that is thought to be done only once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the fre@@ ed@@ b .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if the drive with other programs can be accessed , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card map General Settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information , select information so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / file names or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; Ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; node ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , it is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if it &apos;s worth it . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices need to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send &amp; CD ; submit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously interpreted pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; check out the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; check it out at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with one Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as the default for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described and furnished in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b needs to be picked up . the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each backup &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually rather than fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this hasn &apos;t been done yet , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this is only if the CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for the FAQ section and answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first part
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply coll@@ ectively for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . this option is set up on the encoder settings tab , so take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org web page and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in such a way will be read out . simply click on the line to turn off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at a time .
if you click on the button selection to start reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a co@@ aster that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of part 1 into MP3 format . thus , reading and encoding is parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the encoder &apos;s queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is talking about CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package nowadays . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; node program . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various tabs of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked after starting the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke re@@ up@@ setting of lyrics , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external mi@@ di syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the entry Remove from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song writing and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually set it . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the It@@ ems or Song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired information in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is added automatically to the active collection when opening ( using file Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . when you select the series from the sub@@ menu play@@ out sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs , or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the button Next song , record next song from the menu item or press the arrow key to the right .
to jump around a song , select the button For@@ ward piece , the entry For@@ ward piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map provides general MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer knows .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible with GM ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except the Key@@ nesi@@ an section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
set Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A more Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equals sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key s@@ To M is needed to lay all tones that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do so , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each tone represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ic instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped to a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel . watch the included Key@@ boards as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply use the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will need to be defined with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x is always used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio value indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch benchmark with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file there are no decim@@ al comm@@ as .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that will play a pitch benchmark with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point Channel Re@@ view : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the left and right arrows from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and a good syn@@ thesizer gives you a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files separately .
just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to recover the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automatic Adding to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ I.@@ D. First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally Adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ ge- @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t know anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I only do more programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose Lu@@ z San@@ che@@ z for testing the CI@@ S support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tho@@ und , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an alert or even a supporting e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends considerably on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you have a sound card unless you can of course hear any music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the e @-@ mail lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been completed as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist .
it is possible to save preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you do a file , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose play@@ lists from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without the need to match the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / Rel@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , like the setup of the back@@ end using mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even add the special array em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog of K@@ DE instructions .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order for a given back@@ end to be taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB players ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device can be used and the TV channels can be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings can be found under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ MEs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . )
internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used for comp@@ iling &amp; dump .
latex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . Unix @-@ like systems are likely to be applied to the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ til ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact with the box should be made .
if you have any questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; on or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed on the list box of Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; Reference and the powerful project management have to be called .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its capabilities , consult K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
for and latex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . during the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ sport .
in order to be able to master natural latex ; good books for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size can be specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Rel@@ ocation Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some adjustments to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list includes the most commonly used auxiliary packages for natural latex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the compilation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a brief description of the functions and more information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see more areas of a green text on the screen , it lies with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
automatic execution of the environment will create a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to fill the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . and latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( apart from that is the highest and sub@@ tler the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the return search , the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is j@@ umped . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding site in the DVI @-@ D viewer was j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is ed@@ ged on all th@@ ed@@ es@@ â basis , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection boxes should be show@@ c@@ ased . the selection boxes were developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , feet notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command a term for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection possible over a drop @-@ down box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ tag e is used for setting the font size e . it allows the font sizes to be specified for the main text , the notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two selection options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size e . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code sample has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Build or Quick @-@ Building Kit .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if quick installation should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font e 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow for a change of the font size e within the environment .
the changes will be supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to ease the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background is presented to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; -@@ mark@@ up language now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed out or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are needed ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on a DVI - the document can be printed out by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can start into other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , simply set up Modern under Settings Box ... Tools can be selected .
to perform the selection search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward searching . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; be defined as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is a mistake in using the Quick Draw &amp; DVI file , a bug may be present . if a bug is available , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary .
the logging file er@@ ases the source of error in the source text . in the editor , you can use the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã Â La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ inters among the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the defective line , click on the error in the logging and &amp; box ; jump to the wrong line .
once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written from scratch or used for fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
high @-@ level users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to ease the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template will then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for on an Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and elev@@ ating many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for tools ; can be made directly from &amp; box ; out .
to find out more about &amp; chat ; and its possibilities to learn should consult the K@@ ate manual . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called over the Men@@ u@@ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a valid description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; meaning that the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most diverse types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the natural materials differ ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional boun@@ ce marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu items Edit hop marks or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent options , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands are included in the text selection :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , this does not include a text with plain lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning only includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; box is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will be selected at the end .
for deletion of a part of the document , it is possible to remove this first and remove by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description on the Edit menu .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides ; for more commands under Edi@@ ting environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command closes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environments .
this command jumps to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the welded loop .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded loop .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the welded loop of a &amp; tex ; group # , skip to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted lay@@ ered group par@@ enth@@ eses , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command closes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as gardens . for the purpose @-@ bearing implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two closing quotation marks for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings Box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there may also be specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) and thus German or French quote characters . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a closing line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Box ; add La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and thereby all E@@ t characters ( stamp ; ) among each other . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator does not have the corresponding tab , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; box ; for special orders ( mostly for natural latex ; ) are still extended . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and potentially wor@@ sens the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions will naturally be removed when selecting a command . alternatively , &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump brands can be inserted , so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible with the Edit button N@@ Ã ¤ ste Ho@@ ck mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can make adjustments to these lists . you can choose to select different possible lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as accessories of the general language used .
command mode is not useful for execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used to provide a special mode for execution of environments .
when calling the Compl@@ eted Mode to the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is accomplished , the environment is closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can customize settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of crashes , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Box ... Ki@@ le can be set up completely . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode has been added to the manual C@@ trl + Alt key , the character L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big bott@@ oms are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many people in one document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written orders .
this mode can be set up in the box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled completely . here , the threshold value can also be specified for the display of completion .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is needed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools then can be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to examine the result of the work , you have to compile first the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no lost viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... The following information is asked for the project here :
when exec@@ uting the filen@@ ame , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; box .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ til ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all file and box ; delivered documents and this for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or banner ads . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; desktop environment ; is also part of the Fink project , which means &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed .

&amp; ch@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day , use it with different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you an lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section , save them with C@@ trl ; S file Save , or click Save to the disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Remove or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the toolbar .
open the Di@@ alogue Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . here you can select short@@ cuts for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the user button on the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ not ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the pile insertion is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking a call stack in the shown list , the cursor is transferred in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

if the inspection dialog does not appear , select de@@ bug@@ ging stage manager ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the tab source code in the appearing dialog .
all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT are valid . therefore multiple templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details .
clicking a template in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a card map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g inspec@@ tor &apos;s dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code , in which a global and a local variable is declared
clicking on a variable from the list gives you a summary of the information in the dialog below . if a variable has a specific expression , for example
if , then , a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the expression expression and clicking the expression button .
when you click on a variation entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter in the main window will be added to the corresponding line of this file .
version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s pick it a bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and finish it !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is in the ge@@ aring working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time you start my program .
as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book then just leave the current working folder selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the tick on the current file and select the file to be checked using a different file - file cho@@ oser .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed check option .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; using definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for Relax@@ NG validation is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has one &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then they leave current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ ths , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality at once and do not need to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit Plugins menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as Team Leader and Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze as . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up into the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note inv@@ ali@@ dated .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta Settings ... This dialog covers a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , it will be added to tags for which the closing tag is optional .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update Start@@ - and End @-@ tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic translation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Def@@ ine button , the default settings can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been detected . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly creates backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed in the Editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ card ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the Windows settings to the default when the user interface has changed by changing M@@ DI modes and dock / app@@ end views . it corresponds to the --@@ reset @-@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by means of hooks of no more en@@ quiries .
the location around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in the shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document can be set in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree while editing , and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ yi trunc@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third parties which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the following is required when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . if the plugin is not available at the moment , it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ designed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations over plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ b ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection panel , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of the monitored variables are shown . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gger session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ex@@ its listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts . if a de@@ bug requirement has started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if a request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is requested .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script , where it is possible to get rid of functions and include functions .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog where you can enter a variable or an expression that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the Script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types that include file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbol @-@ oriented lat@@ ches of picture buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool slides . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day displays . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than a single element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
when yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in a dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog box at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us window is to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the schema &gt; element of the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
the following is an example of a working family of 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one and PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a new &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the User Interface button can be used to assign a short@@ cut . with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique will be attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected portion of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the default output , by setting the value in the output sel@@ ector :
when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialog box &quot; Edit Day , &quot; if available to allow an input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ f@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic More Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ing , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is inserted ; Start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , as there are still some , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool bar to set the dialog for settings on the toolbar . make sure the tool bar you want is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the tool to the toolbar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding file .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = func@@ t func@@ name = func@@ .@@ html tags 2 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
the section of contents is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used for creating context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script would display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the features of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as indicated in your doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . you will not get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different points , you can send a menu item like D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending email , sending tool bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others can download it . the posts will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which it uses a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click on OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar toolbar , and start from the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before the installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tag@@ XML format . there &apos;s a simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Download and Con@@ ver@@ ting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that works in the ! doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ arise oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three sections : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool slides . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the construction man@@ si@@ sts , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ ers , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as editing / past@@ ing / inser@@ ting basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the text under the mouse cursor , or opening the file when the string is lab@@ eled under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool slides is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out various fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate to open them and ro@@ am . in the representation with tabs are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context in which they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . further functions are available , such as starting , editing , or sending the script via the right mouse button .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . it allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all the bugs in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts which are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can lock them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is located in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why developers and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool slides , automation can be increased dramatically .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check the templates section . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML while inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ interpreted by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scrip@@ tions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
selecting and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pro@@ pos@@ al or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project administr@@ ates . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be added to the toolbar by means of settings . toolbar operations are saved and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the toolbar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load one &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD can be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , in the Tags menu there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activating or de@@ activating the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied , if that day at this place contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the Card Card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the appropriate sub@@ window .
to@@ ggles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affects any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set up the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or add which and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled in .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be linked . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good man@@ sions .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the Sub@@ Window Pan@@ e , or changed using Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) which are ignored in project related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described .
in the Profile Upload window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for each profile , by specifying one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , it opens and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders also behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can download different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password saved on the disk option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool slides . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool slides can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool slides .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via the toolbar &apos;s toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , toolbar buttons are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to create tool slides from the toolbar . use and addition differ . adding tool slides will be handled at the bottom of the Add Tool@@ bar section .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which the New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , the toolbar can be renamed , where it is possible to specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar ... and set Settings to set actions .
templates are essentially documentary skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates as a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you present for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates provided have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually found in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more special documents are ne@@ sted in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
customize a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As template Save as local template .
once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop templates to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect to &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended as soon as el@@ ter@@ ial attributes are acquired .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template reference . if a root folder has been set in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to complete a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers through copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can use context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active . pressing F@@ 9 activ@@ ates the active cursor from one window to the other , keeping the position in the document .
the synchronization interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set using Settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to edit the document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding . this can be used to modify the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list enables change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key@@ wor@@ d@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
it is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor , moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting by means of a return key or ran@@ ge@@ ster .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool bars , as in the source text editor . note that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , needs to be removed any other anchor day .
some toolbar buttons such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen @-@ Wizard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analy@@ zing style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , you need to compile and install lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed within these lines . and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ value file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and le@@ ases the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anger when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog re@@ members your selection and displays them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
using the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , a folder will be used for B and C , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if merge is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set a output file immediately . you can do this step even later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you only have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that window is optional . ) Each info line has a different color . ( note that window is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare isolated cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; when you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Ski@@ p to next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is selected in all the windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also make a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merge or manual editing ; then the text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue ; no row in the file ; no line in the file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , left , end , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert mode and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture Up / C@@ trl @-@ picture Sub@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ag@@ grav@@ ated .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , every selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
while comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . also when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . normally , only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; will look identical even though they are different . when this option is checked , this option will have to be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
look inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow on very large files .
in the automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving to the next un@@ solved conflict .
automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for the coding feature a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overlay column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then choose to merge the files together . a simple click brings together the merge and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart merge , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor exactly matching your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor exactly matching your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line spac@@ ing to convert the input into upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
the \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only a few details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . subsequent operations only change the data that the line balance algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line comparison pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit a lot of files in one folder . for this reason , you can use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 to recur@@ sively compare and merge entire folders .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually carrying out ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the Invent@@ ory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories are collap@@ sing and all sub@@ directories are opened with which you can open and / or un@@ fold all folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green then becomes yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible file names ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) then a error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is processed after the other . it status column shows skill if the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then you will use C as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , B as the destination and B and / or B will be used as a destination when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current item , select Run action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with options Per@@ forming , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select Start / Continu@@ e , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug , a message appears and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you can see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been combined individually , it will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them once again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific file can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to Files : when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not test for possible recur@@ sions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not result in possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is switched off in default .
perform a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution with caution .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for combining files are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files will be saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can drag the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the window divi@@ der with the mouse and switch between directory and text window between the two views .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge .
this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. .@@ This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed to be a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewers in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assume that the input file produces a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; patch program to restore the missing file .
in kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now available in pare ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 suggests that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool @-@ Collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by st@@ ressing in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have walked this path or who will go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as iden@@ tically . however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to each other , this all@@ is lev@@ ying dence this is more often the case .
the editor re@@ members for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly l@@ ul@@ led ; No sr@@ c has been released ; the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even greater emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the File Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 base folder ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift insertion ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
only entries that show differences are displayed . this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after the merge . ( the behavior will likely change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ places , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button allows you to move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ places .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if it is cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . however , if an application is cli@@ cked within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ized , maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish . the commands perform the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ places .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with their standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very well suited for representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and select setting of switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
at the moment this can &apos;t be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c file with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you have no write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web @-@ designers and people with visual impair@@ ment are interesting . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is lab@@ eled in the following as a selection box .
in the default setting , the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively you may &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still unable to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; likes ; automatically uses your default short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sm@@ aller &amp; etc ; .
may also be known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of benefits : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor stays in the same place for a while . it is thought to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( repe@@ ating @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and pain in every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and cause pain every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , pain that is related to the use of your computer should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t been done yet .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and click away as soon as you stop the movement .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click navi@@ gates .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the left and left will cause a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent moving should be turned off first . if you have used the automatic mouse click then you can later take the smart move away .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should make aware of which places a click of the mouse remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not present a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse @-@ ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent moving but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action , where you will probably have problems with it . here are some advice :
don &apos;t use the intelligent drive if you just start using it and use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means that each time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played ; the mouse button shows a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts when the mouse clicks . later , you can use the intelligent moving also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor wa@@ its briefly . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to the an@@ tigen of the Mau@@ rer syndrome .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released . this way the drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program and mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sets that are to be spoken once again from a list with the conversation history .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are added into words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and basically contains an input field for keyboard input of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the drive memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken once again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ts@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your voice generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using Action@@ Script as a language service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be made available on this page . the kt@@ ur@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the choice of instant speech , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the flow memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered into the input field first .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before Cho@@ osing , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the dictionary currently used for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the language you want for this source ; and mouth ; then reads the language . the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . and mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting in the menu bar , toolbar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the processor .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the processor .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected movements of the processor .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding toolbar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be moved by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with information about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . the bar is arranged by default above the editing window under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up Settings ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command on the card voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer too for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Malay@@ al@@ am are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to further spread it without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder .
for the third example , the option must be sent on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ vet@@ at@@ e.@@ The license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending the data as standard input must be enabled .
the language output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all and k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page displayed in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that people who cannot speak can output text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is saved , which the user can always rec@@ laim .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text through the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers who can be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
the speech output is made using the speech @-@ speech program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the generation of language output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the Voice Edition service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without any visible window that offers T@@ TS services through &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of t@@ ts@@ d over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about and kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ mail mailing list instead . subscribe to the list above ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ enco@@ ded . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ sync ) .
before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the speech speech of your speech . see also
on the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card tab is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use kt@@ ts ; otherwise use the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the tab card driver in t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . it will automatically appear when you launch t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the flash@@ card General and check if Voice Output En@@ able ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can click &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the tab order to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language output system . click the General tab in the General tab to open this card map . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs and kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar system area , it disappears as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , stop , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card badge is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the tab active there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . then check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and then select Tools Text in the Main Menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ lines and other invisible tags are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and then select the Text tab in the Main Menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Note is the news system by &amp; k@@ de ; you are informed about events you set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up a message in an I@@ RC channel in which your nick@@ name occurs . mit &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program k@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for quotes are different depending on the application .
filters for string replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong@@ ly emphasized or faulty messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of frac@@ t@@ ts ; for normal work with frac@@ t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of screen readers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text can be read on a web page , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you initiate by the card board is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and ended .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to regular warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is delivered with pre @-@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for transl@@ ating &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with microphone selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have submitted a female voice on the card reader , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
for setting character string filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these samples are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Gener@@ ate .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , app@@ end the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will be applied only if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ trl key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs can be sent with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter kop@@ ete .
the string release filter is only applied to the text when all the conditions with one entry in the box Remove filter apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited to both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker set up on the card board or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passes to the filter , it searches a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties that the program for@@ gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected , and the features of the speaker set up on the card board are selected .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; node ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements .
use these buttons to save or load your language settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter will only be applied to the text when all the conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD modules API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; you will find the full documentation for both APIs on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the script to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use .
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . start kt@@ ops in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; reform@@ ulate filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation notes appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only g@@ ob@@ s@@ wel@@ sh is output . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ d .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that is not included in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; referring to the source code for k@@ de@@ mapping or downloaded the tar@@ ball created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check that speech syn@@ thesizer works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer , so you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of t@@ ty@@ ts ; it is designed to allow the creation of speech @-@ cre@@ pat@@ ters directly , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can return sentence or paragraph , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application sends Text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
if you click Add actors on the card board and click on Edit to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the tab card is displayed for Festival Interactive . see the modules for details on the modules .
enter the path to the festival program exec@@ utable . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text passed to festival . if voices are known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box is not selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will appear t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on startup . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card reader .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or withdraw in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be shr@@ unk to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and Mess@@ ages are not displayed . for more information about the news types of kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ x@@ . % corresponds to about half and 200@@ .@@ % approximately the double normal speech rate . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt select Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . once the issue of the screen reader has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text read on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . when both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Note messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card notification message appears .
check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will be read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text pre @-@ read , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card reader as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is defined for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the notification settings as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fication will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also , trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional identi@@ fiers ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sets . this allows you to start or stop or stop orders more quickly , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , but beginners will not be advised .
the easiest way to get to know how to set up a speaker can be done by selecting it . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . if you select a speaker , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . of course , you must have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can execute or cancel text orders on the card board even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the regular set of rules is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ation Rec@@ og@@ nition Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional ends and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set limits filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ level detection filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card reader selection , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no language abilities are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a set up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter anything .
check this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is above if you know that a specific application sends text in another language than the language set in the working environment .
to delete all properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete , click the Standard Spe@@ aker button and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr starts immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get any trac@@ eability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it has been finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer may be installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output about AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developer .
in the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the voice speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML ; ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML version filters , and set up the office speed .
I don &apos;t want websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokesperson , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . for this festival no errors are produced , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber has the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I added an own string release filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab orders is displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for del@@ ity detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . it also freezes when you hold a text order and then launch another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .

before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check whether your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the tut@@ orials that are supplied with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , you are searching for a festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phone from German lyrics . more information can be found under .
in this case , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices ; note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enabling the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choosing k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device generally indicates and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best meets the distribution and the release date . by checking the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the definition can be taken permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system administration mode , click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to set up a dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
you can specify the TCP / IP configuration without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask is to be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . switching on an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution part allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be added to the list by selecting an entry or descending or descending in the list with the buttons Hin@@ ts or Her@@ on in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... The dialog window is displayed .
the list of known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of names contains some well @-@ known hosts , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... The Add New alias dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog Def@@ ault Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command in a console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a console ; rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology ; in the second chapter , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never been widely dis@@ semin@@ ated . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the spread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is al@@ loc@@ ating . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person who runs a valid IP address or , if available , can be used by DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all calcul@@ ators are nodes in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which operates like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if a different content is found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected may therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which provided the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; und@@ ress the tape and read the pr@@ elo@@ ad information of the tape . if you don &apos;t know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; dat , the pre @-@ sp@@ ool , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the strip index should be re@@ generated .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been mounted . a corresponding message appears in the status bar . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by fl@@ aps the entry .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape card must be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , it must be format@@ ted before use . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the belt will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the Profile will be saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can review the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the directory for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in any of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog displays settings for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the throughput of the data and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the Working Fol@@ der for Recovery .
once you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput of the data and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can specify the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed in backup files , only the files located on the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered tar independent from the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ un@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command will load load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , it tries to lock the ej@@ ector in the tape drive . it may not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected when it is connected ; do not use this option for floppy @-@ flo@@ ats .
not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been format@@ ted since the age in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be handled directly with &amp; GNU . even other tar versions should work as long as they do not deal with incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information on issues that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information on issues that occur on their server . hence , k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide some advanced features for filtering and evaluating certain programs using the protocol files .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides ; functions that allow easy filtering and sorting of the log lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the system log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . it will not appear to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or string . to do this , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines is now automatically displayed , so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter All . then a log line will only be shown when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the Log File System Protocol , select the column process , and carry out the name of a process in the Log File System Protocol , and then carry out all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . step lines of the step error are indicated with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as the log lines of the step critic . the coloured representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system log , or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can activate the to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also refer to the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when bo@@ oting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I won &apos;t go further to historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting it . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following other folders :
system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel sel@@ ects in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default runtime is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runtime is 3 . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script is called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server runtime level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . I also could have a user Run@@ level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not be tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts from around levels , or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at the present time , there is no way to restore records thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another round level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired runtime with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to the preferences are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ s. and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the PO@@ LO prompt on lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ time to be added to this manual .
this program refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user name and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have activated limited space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card card password management appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are in KB respectively :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the file system file system with space restriction .
the card group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the properties tab displays a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the Add button on the toolbar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group will work analog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , add , remove , add , change , and more .
