<seg id="1">Translate the website's website in the & konqueror; translate menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Automatic translations are very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings... Open the Card Tools tab and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setup modules from the node; addons. please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that contains & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras shutdown. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle Filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM tree of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of graphically representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have reasonable color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle which is switched over view color mode can either be a depth for easy recognition of the depth of the nesting or the mapping of another file property, such as name, owner, group, or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space available to display, or if the area of child rectangles should be displayed (whereby therefore representation errors can be caused by constraints on the mark of the treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With presentation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always respected. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the child's sub-entries is left to the implementation. here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns, or recursive double division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View View on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Image Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Images for each line has a slider and a rotating field to adjust the number of thumbnails in each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Using the box file name of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the View box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">You can use the check box to set the subfolder to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures to the gallery to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file checkbox, you can specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings offers you easy access to the general & HTML settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can view the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; menu under the Navigation Pane window or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser recognition adds a menu item in the & konqueror, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the mapping in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & Edit. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphot2. of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& Edit; try to make the notification of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser displays a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all required information is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to answer you to other users of & digikam. however, you may ask questions to other users of & edited here. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site to learn news about releases released and other information about & edited.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate & digiplug; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for registering in the developer mailing list of & edited;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you move & edited; for the first time, you will be asked where to save your pictures and your database. simply enter path names, or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data dump is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & Edit; you will also use as an AlbenLibrary.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as base folder. & Edit; look at each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; durance recursively the library path across its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it iste in hidden folders. this allows you to paste extra-bs & Edit by inserting a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albendo have no photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can lock in & edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Melodies to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it may also work with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu aid menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh-Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & Edit. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphot2. of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is frequently used as a USB mass storage device.</seg>
<seg id="75">Digital cameras which support an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to hosts and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digicame; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digicted; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach a common module structure for & edited;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & edited; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & Edit; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that you can not store a picture in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name will only work if this is shown in the symbol view. what fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & edited are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the AlbenFeatures or the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the album's properties.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose to scan an album Import Image. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete albums from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by Date with View Albums By Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new: they set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & Edit, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and click on the context menu & quot; As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiplug; supports input of keywords for single photos in the My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait briefly, while the thumbnails will be generated. this allows you to avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is, you can change over settings; set up the Albums tab here and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows appearing when you leave the mouse pointer at a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all you edited and edited. albums and keywords enable you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements. you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 Image Editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & Edit; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata that appears in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. by doing so, this information is lost from the EXIF data and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to right-click on the preview and rotate it. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & edited, it will be moved to the trash bin by & kde; moved. F8 Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& Edit; use the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view, so you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lifesaver; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the image's IPTC data fields, at least for JPEG. you can also re-import your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, it will become the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by right-clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select As a album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop it there. alternatively, you can right-click on the preview of the pictures and assign them from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to him. in this way, you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have tagged a photo, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent, adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a timeframe, just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In addition to the search box, a small lamp is the green when the search finds matches. if you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have saved it, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search is done. the results will be displayed in My Search list in the main window. the Text box Save search as is used to add a name to My Search list to your request. if you want to change your selection once again, select the respective entry from the list My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select a search, the search form will appear again with the search information entered before. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. here are more rules for searching. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, which you can search in certain fields of & Edit; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are automatically added, separated by operators, added. an option can be added to this list with the Find Group / Search group. each option can be added to this list with the Find File / Search group. each option can be combined with other information on the logical operations All..., A..., No... or At least... you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitised; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. by means of a Schwellerts the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the unused search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicted; find the suitable pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally requires that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the box below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added to the list below for later use. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& Edit; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. he works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add to the illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and opened its window. if you are back in & Edit; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you choose to synchronize thumbnails from the toolbar and execute zoo and move operations on one of the images, then they are also executed with the other picture. so you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any preview image to view it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly out of the lighting table, e.g. F4 file Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the picture you need to click on them and hold the & LMB; in the mode Preview both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect, and use photographs again. we focus on the processes for digital photographers which & digikam. we look at downloading, renaming, removing, reviewing, grouping, saving, evaluating, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer inventory management to find a specific photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. they can be quickly found across your location, unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos, you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & Edit. this ensures that EXIF data and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget it, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? & Edit; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often refer to other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import Catalogized images from another source with embedded keywords, then it will be & digitised; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated while the sub-trees are followed.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to share your photos with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you begin to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you might even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motif that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for oneself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit; you can store any amount of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of utilizing geolocation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips by using pictures with geographic data. & Edit; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleMaps. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights in order to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is an endorsement of the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photograph is a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers you the picture to others. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change these metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. & digicted; in the near future, such a module is available for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desastal prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these losses are the same that can happen to you on traditional paper photos or negatives. this section concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which are reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be treated carefully and you may no longer trust you than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even when they are just written. this is why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called isoBuster that seems to work wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the Format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in an unappropriated format. then read the data back to check you. also, do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warranties include a new disk, but not data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short, Disks hold the longest if you are operated at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperature, the error rate increases dramatically. SMART's electronic parts are the most common error reason, SMART can't determine this error. this is especially read errors and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter a lot, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy jokes and grooves the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug connector, but remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protectors which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it therefore makes sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can get for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember to trine all cables before going on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disorders remain undetected until you do not have any protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate interferences in the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the number of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 stops of fundamental physical frontiers. it is meant that while the technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. so, backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re-installation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hits local and destroys a lot. forget about airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as said above, a common reason for data loss despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-driven FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option than to be compatible with the current system. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the entry if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. however, it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can store images in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and is bound to use metadata. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is an extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo, mostly in raw format. however, XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on an architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera editable, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a fine-layered processing. if you edit the images again with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited. in the Adding a Photos to an Album, you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect these to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it will try to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a finished indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not provide preview images. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & Edit; or editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All. this loads all photos from your camera to a single album in & edited;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones using the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the Delete button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New to download is available. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums tab. the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums tab. then select the Album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at one time by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only a few, then you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully taken into a & edited, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually re-used after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can cause duplicate filenames if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard auto identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & edited; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, you can use this to automatically upload subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section bar Meta data, you can read which information your camera could have embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & edited; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to disable this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based sub-verbs at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">A folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want to upload and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position that is indicated in length and width graphs and can be displayed on a map. the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitones, and map references? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, through a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last but not least via manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for Windows and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Phil Harvey ExifTool. it uses the signs of haunted coordinates, such as maps.google, for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com doesn't show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Edit; try to give as much control over its working processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & Edit. to access these settings, you need to change settings in the Settings menu. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set on saved preview or editing image processing. you can therefore set the default behavior of & Edit; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the relevant IPTC data fields when the option is selected from the camera interface when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's footer: this field should include the photographer's job title. these can be names such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description to the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image other & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the respective IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & Edit; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & Edit without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor in the main window rests over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode formats are attempted, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one or edited; album folder that has none of these extensions, edited by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated display of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the light table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one then you can obtain better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting Lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-prone placement, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & Edit, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at the moment, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option traces the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed-lights, so the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to catch the shroud, as continuous white. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digicame; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option Reconstructing, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the Edit & Edit image options. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data, which come from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color frame construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD-Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can place the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for gradation correction as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information such as the color information of a color space in the other is to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture opens in image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & Edit; examine these folders then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be compatible with the camera operator and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include color-tone-mapping or gamma correction. currently, the craw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated. this could be done manually rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface you can & Edit; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will be loaded by & Edit. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Adjustment Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties on the left show a list of all supported cameras at the time. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / mask on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check whether & Edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after setting up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu Cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the trashcan ads, you can edit & edit the conversation; you will find more details when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections delete a photo and delete an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & Edit; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries, otherwise you will need to apply the changes using the Change button.</seg>

<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & Edit, to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & edited, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes a fast image processing with some base tools. you can use it to view your photos and edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digice.For more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting Up Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Recover button from the File menu or using the button The Recover of Image Processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by Edit Backpath or Restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and memorize Ctrl; Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in in the photo and zoom out by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you can enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the Options dialog by & Edit. you can view it from the Edit menu; see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default and kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or whole sets. entire image template pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select the Print Assistant from the Album Export. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & Edit; main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view you can insert or insert lettering with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label panel in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme ranging from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either by one mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the Ctrl + 0... 5 keyboard shortcuts. the evaluation from the sidebar is always applied to one image. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC Regency. the code will follow the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in the Edit & Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can thus quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are saved to the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword to the keyword, please read the keyword keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed on the main window. normally, the left side bar with their Album, Date, Keyword and Search is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created key words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it to the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and note that it has to be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & edited; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is based on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are per email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Springblooms and click Info and then click Info About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB color space or not, you have to calibrate your monitor since sRGB means that your monitor is sRGB, then you must either turn your monitor to sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, adjust, automatic comparison and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the brightness values over the entire image, allowing the darkest point to be black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Levelling: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jisting of all values in between.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicted; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited because there is a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you can go too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Colors White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target picture. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram is displayed that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Ann with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photograph as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depths for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this encoding needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under Colors Sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you will always need the same correction. you will find more information in the manual for sound value correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicted; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar ization, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by exposing a partially developed pressure to a short flash and followed the development of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine-tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers. Velvia's highly saturated colors are too much for some photographers, especially those who do not have any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. any changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool value correction is based on improving the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the sliders for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and to make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the image's settings. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to select whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is most useful. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the highest for the dark tones, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values as interactively as with the input values. compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shades, means and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cam component to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels get darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">If you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipettes buttons create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if detected in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo fixed in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer of the & digicted; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you maintain luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also activate the Monochrome effect, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can save you for later and load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sophaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shawl tones. this is very similar to the process of absence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & Edit; tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed below (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame adding can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame add the module from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. passing through the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you cut the tool according to the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this convenient tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template can apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, simply send an email in English to the Edit menu; edited-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you will need to set your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below you can see three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resizes the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. use the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works more psychometric. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in blurred edges. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a depth filter even while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to call correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should handle it carefully as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image intensifies the tool. under refocusing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften the image softly, and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will amplify the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft alternation between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicted; tool refocussing realizes a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to reverse a picture & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the focus. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filters. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus generally reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing color refocusing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'Faltung. the Gauß' folding has a very long tail, which leads to that the mathematical result also depends on the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: increasing the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring gauge is wrong. in most cases, use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Unsharp Mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred stitching used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob regulates the sharpness of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink will allow an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail capture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and make details sharp. note that a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the depth of detail should always be subordinate to direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value near 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD hashing, a high value may produce wavelsimilar patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothed [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle stepwidth [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. be careful that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integal step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more in quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artifacts. the module is applied to a photograph taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the background that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicted; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-pane details and the Advanced Settings sub-window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance to the front of the filter to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and the noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more corroded.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it can be too high. it can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to softly use the menu item Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicted; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well suited to remove Gauß 'noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old colour photo, which was read by a scanner. you can see the scan-artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug tool Hotpixels allows hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous paragraph, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the Wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixels correction on a color photo, seen from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicted; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, in particular those in the medium and large photo format, can often not even illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they can reduce the edges and edges of the image by allowing the light to reach the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which may increase the required shutter time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there are otherwise unsharpening effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a image that has been done without this filter. the vignetting correction tool applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further controls of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the highest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or random a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reducing it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options. the controls only provide positive values, because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target picture, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicted; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grader handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect but flat on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grade corrects the removed corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">This value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'Corner Parameters' has the reverse character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size, resulting in a correction of the first grading. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as all first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tone-shaped correction, the effect would seem obvious to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the Cutting Tool from the Edit Pane Cut from image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters setting film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add movie granule option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes ink channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver particles of photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere loosened from daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film additive effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that used the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicted; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicted; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicted; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal graph. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to sketch you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicted; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Zoom: blurts the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a central point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: camera shooting from a car or train.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the ink tank in the picture and wipes out these without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirroring or turning into the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the Edit Translation or Transformers mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photography inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change sizes in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for resizing is using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try to blow up the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this. enlarge any staging for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and drag a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been magnified to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear expansion by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file saving file or save file from the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folder aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the max ratio button to set the range to the maximum possible depending on the ratio and orientation chosen.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the fixing help make it possible to hide Help in order to better compile your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will give you good results for your photos. compared to the third-hand gel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also diverge from the above mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way, you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicted; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. now, move the mouse into the image preview to position the two lines. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformers trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. but be aware of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New Height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit smeared. for a single adaptation, this effect is small but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Adjust your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture gets blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two certifications are twice as much blurred and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the picture has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from & digikam. see the Configuration section for more information on how to use modules with & Edit.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far, there has been no modern & GUI; program included, and X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphic viewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph is recalculated and represented in & kgraphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or open the graphs in & kgraphic viewer; in one & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these knots)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; -program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphic viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar can only open the icon file and open the (empty) list Recently opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded in & kgraphiviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Setting cviewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphene file outside of a running & kgraphic viewer; file, & eg; in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphic viewer; or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">With the program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page should be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed across several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut store page gives the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to set the behavior of & kgraphic viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the option to set the starting behavior of & kgraphic viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) the files of the last session or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with one click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphiviz layout algorithms. the entries as described on the page of & Graphiviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm calculates the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springback model layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">Der & Circo; algorithm ranks the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command that will then run from a shell. the command should accept the graphene file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms can also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directional or unexecuted) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">Using the KIPI module, tools are available to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you need to have installed kooka and sane.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu item, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears to replace the default values ducrhe's own to select your image. see the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window will be displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the Scan button, wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore produces very large files. you also need to select the folder and # 160; you must also select or create the image by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen photos can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked up the complete desktop, only the window under the mouse is read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other desktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screen shot is made, the dialog box options appear with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="785">This module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K3b burning program. you can simply select the albums you want to archive. an HTML interface can be created for easy navigation. also, the Autoplay option is available for Windows platforms.</seg>
<seg id="786">KIPI modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions. you can integrate additional menus, keyboard shortcuts and other capabilities into the program. you can install as many modules within the calling program as many modules as you want.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, present your camera's photos online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of creating a token. it is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented after successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access authorisations that the module displays. at the moment the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillily options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery-export has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image's metadata. geographic data are stored in the EXIF words of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to localize pictures geographically in the spherical coordination system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsyou can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to perform a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data taken at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera timezone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below this, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a place for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation and difference options can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button Correlation to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog box displays the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and increase sie.Adjust this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exibition tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to ensure the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selector allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed in a hierarchical way. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below will show the Albenvorschau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each image creates a page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dexterity Show</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLXLS, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the default color depth, which naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail preview window allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module generates the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred while generating. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the colour information takes place. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. in addition, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please see exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diasau. after that, you can start creating the module via Tools MPEG Diasau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the image or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG export file. keep the extension mpg as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your needs, you can start encoding the movie with the code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings icon at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: expect from dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for white balance should be used. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can later edit the image.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG version can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently, or otherwise use the JPEG format, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use canceling.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the option to override existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change in size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you selected. click the Add Images button to add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Pay attention not to sending many pictures at one time. most email accounts have limitations to the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button Close, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diasau module, a window with questions like your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option allows the file name of the images to be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose to indicate that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">A delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance, however, depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can with & kphotoalbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, now in each group, thus in people, locations and in the group keywords are entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">Selecting another person will only show the images on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save their own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the image below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. please note that you can display the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you will need to select the picture-view window (described in more detail) and in the context menu, you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the View window, you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the View Window you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are scanned according to this text. if you want, you can also enter a date by which you want to be searched; the date can either be a part of the total date, i.e., in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the website of & kphotoalbum; and watch the Quick Relation, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Get photo album; and in the first dialog select the demo, if you want & knot album; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can test the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. if you select an area, only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces two options to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; the one is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create from the File menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout, and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & knot album; export file should be created that is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information being displayed to the viewer without any description. for example, all images are exported from a party. you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unambiguous, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not need to download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder is saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. for the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. a subfolder is created in these settings, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a great deal of time doing the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manual operation near the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copied image near the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you still want to, just select the Export Data option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size limit. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu Import..., the exported database will be imported as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside several picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will follow the various steps of (1) set the information about your images, through (2) searching and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, such as Normal Backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and will automatically reuse it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; for example: photo album -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; setup... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of an intermediary as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left-hand side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules with the Demo Database before using them on your own images. don't say I would have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphoto album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications categorize their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules to make use of the features with & kphoto album.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & knot album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with any other KDE application, you can see a menu and a toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not include much information, as you don't have any information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any picture with notes. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the image has been taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text field by specifying persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: if you have a family celebration for example, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can see that the names used are moved upwards, the persons can find and arrange them more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical list, click on the sorting icon on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image separately, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments. in this case simply click on the above and back buttons, which are under the preview of the image on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a header. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Notebook, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry into a category and drop it to a sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a box by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... button, which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade out a frame completely. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and then pop up the window. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you have not set any filters. an example can be found here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, images can also be used without you saved to the disk. in the picture you will need to record the pictures somewhere to record & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut is not saved to the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again. so if you want to avoid getting rid of your images, please buy a larger disk to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you can filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to see your little sister can control and click to lock the menu entry Everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set which images are to be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item to block images, so that all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the pictures back, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, everyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to block the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphoto album; manage and spend hours over hours doing it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, you have a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see them. of course, it shows the image, but additional information that you have to enter through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the matching entries to this display. so if you click Anne Helene, the browser displays all images of Anne Helene. as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and down the picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. by using the Minus button, you can zoom out the plus button in the middle of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the Point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the power button sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work for videos that are in and out are the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can turn the image with the script functions from the context menu. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the interrupt and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view, see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available in your browser. so you can see them in the browser. so if you want to edit, print or whatever you selected, just copy them all at once. this is described in detail. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you let categories display in a particular preview screen, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your gemold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to activate the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; select View on the image from the context menu. to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovetier; you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object already selected, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Create menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop down menu is displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can invoke the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the Properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered as default. if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility Level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the Visibility Level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the Visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">The object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them in any way. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of the view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">You can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the Anfal bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the Anfal bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window arrangement... Save. a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. this version is not supported in & kpovaroid; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a fast preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that are used & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or gradient effect in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard one adaptive, non-recursive method is adaptive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split again and again, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray each pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, a grid of 4 pixels will be calculated by tracking a specific increment of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Ten percent of the population of the population (b 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and examined for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on ittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the associated rays have not encountered any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovetier; not yet the full command set by & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeling; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code to the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste into & kpovmodeling; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovray; a scene rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, opens & kpovaroe; the & Povray; user documentation of the displayed object. set here the path to your retention and version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail accuracy for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate channel smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render mode section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window orders section, explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement field: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tabs you get a card map view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovaroid; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you create. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree instantly change according to these settings. as a result, you can see here the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a squad (insert the final body Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovetier; it actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited final level. if you render the scene, the level stretches as far as the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to practice one unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select Displacement and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment only shows a matte black material, because you still have to enter the pigment changes. therefore, always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the roader and the sphere in the preview, click on the Apply button and then open the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicolor. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicolor. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the checkboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Always color monochrome in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic functioning of & kpovmodeling; the ball can be easily created as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Unicolor and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or hit the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovetier offers; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracysourcing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the rendering of hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect. so the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeling;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Backpaths.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find Options for Setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set pre-set shortcuts for & kpovaroids; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovaroids using this option; Add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic shapes. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & quot; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field will appear in the lower right corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Set Up & kuickShow dialog, there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, shortcuts for the display window and shortcuts for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are usually found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has its own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'dialogue --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, the exec () function is usually used. thus, dcop &gt; can be invoked relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the length of the unit).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry has been clicked. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script addcustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script addcustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to perform, e.g., saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as .skript.cat.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as the Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the catchscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, rather than having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collection Browser and Quick Find, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to listen to? then the playlists browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. in addition, many different audio systems can be used so you can choose to listen to your music. these and many more useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and autoconf, you shouldn't have trouble with compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers also enable further setting options in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; Browse to music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to browse both the selected as well as their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the Playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the Combination Field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, additional setup in the MySql window is required.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok. under calculator: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered, under which the database is reachable. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Call up similar interpreters: after activating this setting, call & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the played piece. you can view the list in context browsers. note: you do not need last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the kdelib package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to e.g. find modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes while reading Meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes while editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by email (the email will automatically open when a crash happens). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information but do not label it as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only appears an empty playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the start-up window was converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window there is a running text displaying the current play or the current stream. just below is the area, the play time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window includes a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, magnificable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included in the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 pre-settings, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the Main Menu or click on the EQ in the Player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use but still powerful enough even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows are explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the sub-window has started. the information displayed there has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you will see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music sub-window. right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will pop up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in each area to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then choose from the context menu one of the options to add a piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you do not yet run a text script, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database, and no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com according to the song text for the current play (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by artist and there will be a further division according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorts to artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums in your collection are sorted alphabetically by one another. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces will be sorted first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-track your collection once you have something on the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the tool bar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a drop-down box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Adjust the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media players - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the media player. see the Media Player browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this artist burn / Burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the garbage bins... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition, whereupon it appears among various artists.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Canceling compilation-marking - Changes a record selected as a composition back into a normal album. the album will then no longer be shown under Various Artists, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The sub-window Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod, you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by artist in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick music from a given URL. for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case, holding down the Shift key will be helpful: as a result, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter words separated by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all keywords. for example, if you enter one or two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found which contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this is what Mike Oldfield is looking for, but not for entries, such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: - something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add to add playlist to the playlist. to the right, you will find Playlist, Empty Playlist and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will pop-up and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">A unique, magnified analyzer is located in the middle of the toolbar. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as what you can see in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be changed easily by double clicking the mouse into the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Clicking on this entry opens the Visualization Plugins window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration includes a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will play first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the play in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-defined (the details to set up this follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio libraries). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you do not need a Last.fm profile to work with that dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double-click on the playlist, drag it to the playlists window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly. the playlists Recommended Pieces starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first play.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: setting Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be disabled again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button empties the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode. edit playlist will open the dialog for editing the playlist, and you can change the corresponding settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Right-clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit. as a result, the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist right here, but the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be skipped and they will not duplicate a piece in this playlist. if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed, taking into account the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continuously grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The right-hand settings have already been described in the previous section. on the left-hand side of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you tick several playlists, you will add random pieces from each of the playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Setting.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; script by clicking on the script. it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected to install. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also fetch new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1426">If you don't want to use a script any longer, you can delete it. select the script to delete and then click Uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="1427">If you are looking for information about writing your own scripts, please refer to the section Write a script.</seg>
<seg id="1428">The dialog window Visualization Plugins are used to enable the available visualizations in & Amarok; the window contains a list of all available plug-ins. to use a plugin, simply activate the check box next to the name.</seg>
<seg id="1429">This Quick Start will show you how to use & k3b to create an audio CD in four steps. to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of & k3b; and have a folder with audio files.</seg>
<seg id="1430">This is a dialog box where you can select which files to burn to CD.</seg>
<seg id="1431">If you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other low-loss compressed formats, remember that when you re-code to MP3, you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bitrate is. you can check if an audio CD was created by a lossless format.</seg>
<seg id="1432">In this dialog box you can do nothing. please wait until the computer has finished the burning process.</seg>
<seg id="1433">This Quick Start will show you how to use & k3b; copy a data CD in just four steps. to understand the steps you have to have an executable installation of & k3b; and have inserted the source CD into the CD-Rom drive.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Open the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button Burn, the & k3b; the burning dialog can be opened only if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described about the What is the? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you merge files for a multi-session CD. this is useful for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD onto another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD, which you can then burn sometime later. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copying. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial, which of the accompanying programs will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to be able to use the command line functions, you need to make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; features features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void fosnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively one can create a project about the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString Transparent) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void setVolumeID (QString Selid)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT smooth / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; audio CD; it can easily be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoding that encodes these wav files by default (these encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, selecting the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if it is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything by themselves. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction to encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading out a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, all being manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, you can find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB query of the CD data according to the setup of request on the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start the reading and - if an Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it should be noted that the encoder in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, picks) for program events (such as read & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the Main Setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, differences become less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless delivered with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting usually should provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. well enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps compression rate. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. well enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and autochteoequipment. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed with & audio creator; and create the encoding program to create folder and file names and the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labeling in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can upload information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of Pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (translated by the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any information publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained from a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only be the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when & audio creator; to use freedb, the next underlying mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides an up-to-date list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save songs from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if it has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. on the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information on encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading picker on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, ognc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are still uncertain about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg; trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"" "the first section covers the basic set-up of" "" "creator of" "" "and" "" "creator" "" "; something that is thought to be done only once." ""</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download the freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive with other programs can be accessed, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card map General Settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, select information so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download over the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, is a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / file names or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; Rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & node; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection boxes and freedb will not be used. however, you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, it is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if it's worth it. to freedb in offline mode, the two choices need to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the internet. how do the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls are bocking the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send & CD; submit data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously interpreted pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one with just an existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out the last piece: check this to the & CD; check it out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with one Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as the default for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described and furnished in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb needs to be picked up. the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each backup & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a & CD; therefore you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually rather than fetching them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this hasn't been done yet, now the & CD; in the drive that has been defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this is only if the CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for the FAQ section and answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks of the songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; keys for your & CD; there, a window will pop up and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first part</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current title' input field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Actual Title' input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for individual comments per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply collectively for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator. this option is set up on the encoder settings tab, so take a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org web page and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked in such a way will be read out. simply click on the line to turn off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the button selection to start reading the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a coaster that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of part 1 into MP3 format. thus, reading and encoding is parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. the computer with an AMD64 appears to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the encoder's queue. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the entry Remove from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song writing and again others. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so you don't have to manually set it. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the Items or Song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the menu collection under the point Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired information in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is added automatically to the active collection when opening (using file Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. when you select the series from the submenu playout sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs, or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button Next song, record next song from the menu item or press the arrow key to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump around a song, select the button Forward piece, the entry Forward piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map provides general MIDI events in events that the synthesizer knows.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible with GM (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except the Keynesian section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Set Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "A more Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equals sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKey sTo M is needed to lay all tones that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each tone represents another percussionic instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc.) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped to a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel. watch the included Keyboards as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will need to be defined with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The PitchBenderRatio value indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch benchmark with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file there are no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that will play a pitch benchmark with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point Channel Review: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the left and right arrows from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and a good synthesizer gives you a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to recover the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or go (if I want to play a MIDI file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatic Adding to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.I.D. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically Adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga.

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: large- @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list with friends of & kmid; but if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends considerably on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you do a file, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose playlists from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected, without the need to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and altering [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / Rel.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc, like the setup of the backend using mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even add the special array embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog of KDE instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to run in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order for a given backend to be taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB players; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device can be used and the TV channels can be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings can be found under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vd source.</seg>

<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file is created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output eart of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return search, the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is jumped. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding site in the DVI-D viewer was jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is edged on all thedesâ basis, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be showcased. the selection boxes were developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Other is for inserting items such as keywords, feet notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a term for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection possible over a drop-down box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ tag e is used for setting the font size e. it allows the font sizes to be specified for the main text, the notes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two selection options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size e. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code sample has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Build or Quick-Building Kit.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if quick installation should be started & eyepiece, it should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font e 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow for a change of the font size e within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will be supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no reduction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to ease the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is presented to write the source text with the & latex; -markup language now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & box;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few passages in fat and cursive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed out or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are needed (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on a DVI - the document can be printed out by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can start into other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, simply set up Modern under Settings Box... Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To perform the selection search, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on forward searching. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; open and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Ocular; be defined as text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is a mistake in using the Quick Draw & DVI file, a bug may be present. if a bug is available, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file erases the source of error in the source text. in the editor, you can use the previous LaTeX errors and NÃ Â LaTeX errors for sprinters among the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the defective line, click on the error in the logging and & box; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be re-written from scratch or used for fast creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-level users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to ease the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding).</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template will then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for on an Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and elevating many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for tools; can be made directly from & box; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more about & chat; and its possibilities to learn should consult the Kate manual. users of & Kile; can start working directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called over the Menuhelp LaTeX reference. it contains a valid description of nearly all commands that can be used in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; meaning that the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search the most diverse types of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the natural materials differ; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional bounce marks. this is a separate type of bookmark inside the text. the menu items Edit hop marks or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent options, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code added; special commands for their selection. under Edit, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). with a paragraph, this does not include a text with plain lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning only includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bent thing in & box is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also contains & latex; commands with a stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) will be selected at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For deletion of a part of the document, it is possible to remove this first and remove by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description on the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile provides; for more commands under Editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overlook can be lost quickly. this command closes the last opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by braces {...}. under Editing TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the welded loop.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded loop.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the welded loop of a & tex; group #, skip to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested layered group parentheses, the overlook can be lost quickly. this command closes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as gardens. for the purpose-bearing implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple quotes" is used. & Kile; knows this case and supports two closing quotation marks for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings Box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There may also be specific settings (e.g. German or French) and thus German or French quote characters. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment close t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a closing line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Box; add LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and thereby all Et characters (stamp;) among each other. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tab in the above line. although this tabulator does not have the corresponding tab, add & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, this has been added in & box; for special orders (mostly for natural latex;) are still extended. three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & box; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last character of the input will be removed and potentially worsens the completion list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions will naturally be removed when selecting a command. alternatively, & Kile; also jump brands can be inserted, so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible with the Edit button NÃ ¤ste Hock mark and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Box; set up... Kile; you can make adjustments to these lists. you can choose to select different possible lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as accessories of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are often used to provide a special mode for execution of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the Completed Mode to the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the environment is closed automatically. once & Kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Box; set up... Kile; you can customize settings to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of crashes, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Box... Kile can be set up completely. for example, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode has been added to the manual Ctrl + Alt key, the character L will be replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Big bottoms are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many people in one document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written orders.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the box... Kile can be disabled completely. here, the threshold value can also be specified for the display of completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation, Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is needed, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools then can be converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the result of the work, you have to compile first the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the MenÃ ¼ s Creating compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4, using Alt; 4, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and by Alt; 5 the PS file is viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no lost viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project New Project.... The following information is asked for the project here:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename, the relative path must be specified from the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows executing ECMAScript codes. the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of & box.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; provides a lot of different aids to support users.</seg>

<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packets are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & box; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textil; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as a possible help, & tetex; / textil; the small application of texdoctk, which contains a database with all file and box; delivered documents and this for a graphical surface.</seg>

<seg id="1916">Version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration into & quantaplus; all these tools use commanders as a surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who has worked with the & kde documentation knows me and how outstanding it is. let's pick it a bit, let's give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and finish it!</seg>

<seg id="1920">As already said, anyone who has already worked on the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the opened file is index.dobook then just leave the current working folder selected. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.dobook is found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; laths, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plugin system very powerful. you can benefit from additional functionality at once and do not need to wait until someone uses the fake in & quantaplus; the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit Plugins menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a storage location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the nick name of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as Team Leader and Subproject Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze as. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone was working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up into the CVS, as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Annotation is simple. either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the parentheses and the: make the note invalidated.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for script and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up using Quanta Settings... This dialog covers a number of pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, it will be added to tags for which the closing tag is optional.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update Start- and End-tag: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic translation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. using the Define button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies, so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed in the Editor area or in a separate view (or the documentation in a flashcard), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the Windows settings to the default when the user interface has changed by changing MDI modes and dock / append views. it corresponds to the --reset-layout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The location around the behavior of & VPL; to change. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source view in the shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the figure of the Parser node in the document can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree while editing, and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifyi truncation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are part-applications from third parties which can be re-used by any KPart-enabled application, most well known & konqueror; the following is required when inserting a plug-in:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. if the plugin is not available at the moment, it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redesigned. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows different implementations over plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for using & gub; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection panel, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of the monitored variables are shown. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it shares the plugin to listen to Debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that you don't have to pay attention to it normally.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugger session Starte the session. closes the connection to debugger or exits listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instruct the debugger to start executing the script and sending information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution starts. if a debug requirement has started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instruct the debugger to start executing the script without informing variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if a request is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is requested.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next statement in the script, where it is possible to get rid of functions and include functions.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where you can enter a variable or an expression that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of documentation. & kxsl; is a front end and a part of xsldbg that you can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup and scripting languages and & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the Script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contain two file types that include file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symbol-oriented latches of picture buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be manually created (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then file descriptionrc; and also tool slides. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. that is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, that means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in a dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will not cause any leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog box at the top of the & quantaplus window is to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check is performed only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the schema &gt; element of the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family of 2 TagXML file. in this file, one and PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD's DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a new & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the User Interface button can be used to assign a shortcut. with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique will be attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can accept input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected portion of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the default output, by setting the value in the output selector:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use, enable dialog box "Edit Day," if available to allow an input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kifedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic More Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon not only helps you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, staring, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is inserted; Start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, as there are still some, or confirm with OK to finish.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the tool bar to set the dialog for settings on the toolbar. make sure the tool bar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the tool to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its file descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = [Context] ContextList = funct funcname = func.html tags 2 = func.html tag2 = tag 2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of contents is the area of the docrc file that is used for creating context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script would display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the features of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as indicated in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different points, you can send a menu item like DTD DTD (DTEP) sending email, sending tool bars with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others can download it. the posts will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which it uses a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your private GPG-key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can be empty) and click on OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start from the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before the installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tagXML format. there's a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Download and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that works in the! doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarise oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to familiarize them with these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three sections: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool slides. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the construction mansists, the tabs with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all flashers, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as editing / pasting / inserting basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the text under the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string is labeled under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool slides is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill out various fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate to open them and roam. in the representation with tabs are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context in which they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. further functions are available, such as starting, editing, or sending the script via the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. it allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all the bugs in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts which are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the Chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can lock them in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why developers and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and tool slides, automation can be increased dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help center help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. check the templates section. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML while inserting from the clipboard, so they are displayed correctly and not misinterpreted by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; write, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / from. this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scriptions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Selecting and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Proposal or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project administrates. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar, which only creates the name. actions must be added to the toolbar by means of settings. toolbar operations are saved and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't yet saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar will be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD can be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags menu there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivating the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar is denied, if that day at this place contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or cause unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the Card Card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affects any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set up the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add which and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is automatically filled in.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension web prj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be linked. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good mansions.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded from the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the SubWindow Pane, or changed using Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible) which are ignored in project related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile Upload window, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for each profile, by specifying one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens and quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders also behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can download different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password saved on the disk option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool slides. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply changing the view, various files and tool slides can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool slides.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via the toolbar's toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of and quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbar buttons are available in & quantaplus; the best way to create tool slides from the toolbar. use and addition differ. adding tool slides will be handled at the bottom of the Add Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which the New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, the toolbar can be renamed, where it is possible to specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and set Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentary skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates as a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; templates provided have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). binary templates are usually found in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more special documents are nested in appropriate subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Customize a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As template Save as local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop templates to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and backup. by default it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers or dynamically connect to & PHP; create, insert or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps and $HOME / .kde / apps / Quanta / apps. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blended as soon as elterial attributes are acquired.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template reference. if a root folder has been set in such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to complete a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers through copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first one, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active. pressing F9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization interval between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set using Settings Quanta. by choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to edit the document properties. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding. this can be used to modify the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list enables change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor, moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by means of a return key or rangester.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the tool bars, as in the source text editor. note that inserting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, needs to be removed any other anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what was changed within these lines. and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-value file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and leases the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more anger when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog remembers your selection and displays them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merging folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, a folder will be used for B and C, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to set a output file immediately. you can do this step even later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you only have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (note that window is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (note that window is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare isolated cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription:, the filename and [Change] when you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Skip to next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is selected in all the windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also make a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merge or manual editing; then the text & lt; no row in the queue; no row in the file; no line in the file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, left, end, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert mode and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating with which you can jump to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Up / Ctrl-picture Subway) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if this is enabled, whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline\\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, every selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters will not be ignored. also when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others only save a newline '\'. normally, only a line feed '\' will look identical even though they are different. when this option is checked, this option will have to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Look intensely after even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving to the next unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and executing a merge. see for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will be added to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for the coding feature a short notice of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can set the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overlay column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then choose to merge the files together. a simple click brings together the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merge, then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor exactly matching your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor exactly matching your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line spacing to convert the input into uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line balance. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs only a few details. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for displaying and merging. subsequent operations only change the data that the line balance algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line comparison preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit a lot of files in one folder. for this reason, you can use & kdiff3 to recursively compare and merge entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the Inventory menu contains two functions All subdirectories are collapsing and all subdirectories are opened with which you can open and / or unfold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be chosen automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green then becomes yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible file names; copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging (unsure) then a error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after the other. it status column shows skill if the merge was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then you will use C as the target in the Three-Folder merge mode, B as the destination and B and / or B will be used as a destination when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that may skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current item, select Run action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with options Performing, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select Start / Continue, or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a bug, a message appears and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you can see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, it will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them once again. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries are merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder-specific file can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to Files: when the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not test for possible recursions. (note that & kdiff3; does not result in possible recursions.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Perform a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, if the modification date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for combining files are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files will be saved in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible while merging individual files; you can drag the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can disable the window divider with the mouse and switch between directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. .This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed to be a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Trust of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewers in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to launch KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is applied as a KPart, & kdiff3; assume that the input file produces a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the KDiff and Kdiff2 (now available in pare) are already available. in addition, the name Kdiff3 suggests that it can merge as the diff3 from the Diff-Tool-Collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by stressing in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have walked this path or who will go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identically. however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines of next to each other, this allis levying dence this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lulled; No src has been released; the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even greater emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the File ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install diff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3 base folder; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insertion) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries that show differences are displayed. this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after the merge. (the behavior will likely change in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">If you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini-preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the workplaces, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle mouse button allows you to move windows within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if it is clicked on the empty Background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries Pager set up... and exit. however, if an application is clicked within & Kpager, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimized, maximizing, On Desktop and Finish. the commands perform the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workplaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is ticked, the name of the virtual desktops will be shown in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is ticked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as a background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with their standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, the virtual desktops appear in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very well suited for representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and select setting of switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can't be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc file with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice versa. if you have no write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package is kdebase, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse cursor waits for a while at the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and cause pain every mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, pain that is related to the use of your computer should consult a doctor if this hasn't been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by moving the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and click away as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click navigates.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button waits before it leaves the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the left and left will cause a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent moving should be turned off first. if you have used the automatic mouse click then you can later take the smart move away.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of which places a click of the mouse remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not present a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse-ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of the mousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent moving but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or perform any other action, where you will probably have problems with it. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the intelligent drive if you just start using it and use kmousetool. instead, select text instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this means that each time & kmousetool is played; the mouse button shows a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts when the mouse clicks. later, you can use the intelligent moving also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X Window must be installed. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor waits briefly. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to the antigen of the Maurer syndrome.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you initiate by the card board is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; referring to the source code for kdemapping or downloaded the tarball created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check that speech synthesizer works properly with your voice synthesizer, so you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of ttyts; it is designed to allow the creation of speech-crepatters directly, and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can return sentence or paragraph, repeat, stop or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application sends Text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will automatically be the best matching speaker. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; select a speaker, see in.</seg>

<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the festival program executable. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text passed to festival. if voices are known, this setting will be done automatically. generally, Western languages are used ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box is not selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will appear ttsmgr on startup. otherwise, only the symbol kttsmgr will appear in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, voice speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also, trademarks for controlling the pronunciation of abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd" &gt; Who has slept in my bed?</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional identifiers (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single sets. this allows you to start or stop or stop orders more quickly, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; a set limiter filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add more propositional filter filters, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get to know how to set up a speaker can be done by selecting it. turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read. if you select a speaker, change some properties and check how the speaker's choice is changed. of course, you must have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can execute or cancel text orders on the card board even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular set of rules is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional ends and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the propositional boundaries (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set limits filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-level detection filter from default, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card reader selection, you can override the language settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card board speaker). in other words: no language abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a set up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is above if you know that a specific application sends text in another language than the language set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all properties in the area speaker, which is most likely to delete, click the Standard Speaker button and then use the speaker that best matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr starts immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; it has been finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, a not compatible version of GStreamer may be installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA doesn't work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the console; appears a message stating: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">The problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. for possible solutions, please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) on www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint. as a guide, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesize modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the voice speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML;) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to SSML version filters, and set up the office speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't want websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesperson, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER doesn't seem to work. for this festival no errors are produced, the xsl file for converting SSML to Saber has the GENDER tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I added an own string release filter and now I can go in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the tab orders is displayed, the job consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question marks, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for delity detection.</seg>

<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by calling the command-register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedescalator)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. it also freezes when you hold a text order and then launch another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet again.</seg>

<seg id="2794">Start kttmsgr. click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and EPOS TTS voice synthesizer. if the EPOS programs do not stand in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the card reader. enter the input fields in a & Console; epos -h or say -h to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quellopher voice synthesizer that has been written in & Java; i.e. you have to install the Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can neither adjust the pitch, volume nor speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any voice synthesizer, which can be controlled in a console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; enabling the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by choosing kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device generally indicates and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best meets the distribution and the release date. by checking the setting of non-recurring questions, the definition can be taken permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system administration mode, click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... to set up a dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">You can specify the TCP / IP configuration without dhcp or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the field netmask the subnet mask is to be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can see if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or turned off. switching on an off-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or turned off. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution part allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be added to the list by selecting an entry or descending or descending in the list with the buttons Hints or Heron in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... The dialog window is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of known hosts describes the hostname-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of names contains some well-known hosts, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known host and click Add.... The Add New alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit... The dialog Default Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings module are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, you have to set the following command in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a console; rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology; in the second chapter, all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely disseminated. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently concentrating on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is allocating. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact person who runs a valid IP address or, if available, can be used by DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all calculators are nodes in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 to its own so-called loopback interface, which operates like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if a different content is found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which provided the capability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be used by & kdat. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; undress the tape and read the preload information of the tape. if you don't know the preload on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & dat, the pre-spool, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the strip index should be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been mounted. a corresponding message appears in the status bar. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by flaps the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape card must be formatted before you can use it to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, it must be formatted before use. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, the tape continues. all data on the belt will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the Profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so-selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can review the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the directory for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in any of the archives and select the menu entry Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog displays settings for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the throughput of the data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the Working Folder for Recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput of the data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can specify the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed in backup files, only the files located on the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry is considered tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; & lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-unwinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted, the command will load load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, it tries to lock the ejector in the tape drive. it may not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is automatically ejected when it is connected; do not use this option for floppy-floats.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat, a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the age in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be handled directly with & GNU. even other tar versions should work as long as they do not deal with incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information on issues that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information on issues that occur on their server. hence, ksystemlog; attempts to provide some advanced features for filtering and evaluating certain programs using the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides; functions that allow easy filtering and sorting of the log lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the system log; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. it will not appear to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or string. to do this, enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines is now automatically displayed, so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter All. then a log line will only be shown when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the Log File System Protocol, select the column process, and carry out the name of a process in the Log File System Protocol, and then carry out all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. step lines of the step error are indicated with a more conspicuous color as the log lines of the step critic. the coloured representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system log, or in the Cron protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the to new lines in the main window's context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also refer to the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when booting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go further to historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting it. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">System services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel selects init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runtime is 3. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script is called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runtime level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. I also could have a user Runlevel, which & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not be trivial: just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts from around levels, or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at the present time, there is no way to restore records thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various working areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another round level, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runtime with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to the preferences are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard running levels. and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the POLO prompt on linux single and press the Enter key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This program refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user name and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have activated limited space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings. additional flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are in KB respectively:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the file system file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The properties tab displays a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the Add button on the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO BootManager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, add, remove, add, change, and more.</seg>
