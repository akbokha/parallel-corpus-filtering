although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the United States .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very warm love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of the mountain as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and tuned for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , which receives people from around the world , a deeply faithful man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps de Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; ( C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er ) .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at play .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew &apos;s Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
ordering the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. D. Ü ) : as much as &quot; the revol@@ t of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play , which means so much as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a vast majority of the White America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton Mr Khan had a word change with the crowd .
Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried they and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , the message said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children won &apos;t spoil their love for music through garbage
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
pic@@ tured by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what did the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commun@@ e in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca and the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the children &apos;s lives , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from nearby pre@@ historic pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students became central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its use of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is located practically at the top of the biggest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made of waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he never had seen before : a waste produced from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
each year , the world generates about 1 billion tons of garbage .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to hire one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia owing to the pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stopping illegal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is being caught is hidden , and it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ respect of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , which circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships fishing in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is charging its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license , where they were on the move and possibly whether they were a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose each year due to illegal fish@@ ers entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is attrac@@ ting commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake ro@@ y@@ alties , specifying fanta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
in cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system which aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal vessels that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide using the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meeting with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that were previously conf@@ is@@ cated without licence and hardly counted with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile record a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fis@@ her boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets that were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are gone by illegal fishing every year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia had its first major triumph : in October , it posed Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they have a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the refund of Venezuela ) can be seen as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas flat @-@ land area , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centre @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is noticeable in the everyday life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of fundamental change at the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluc@@ tance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of government resolution as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( such as : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images , which tell about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony from the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round that forms the extent of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an official inauguration procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are forged .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , did little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and pre@@ tended to refra@@ in from mu@@ til@@ ating critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city Cór@@ doba .
now , as adult male , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano didn &apos;t choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Batt@@ ali@@ on 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there , I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called on me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended yourself with one of the ERP systems .
don &apos;t forget to kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the revolutionary arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners will be tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just anything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch tor@@ tured on the people .
she looked like a bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying just there .
they rarely struck a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it on with water and ch@@ ased him a 220 volt battery into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound to bind the eye .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose Luis L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance there were people sitting quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero attacked and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was killed by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ ts came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - of eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that you take away from an enemy that you fought .

but if you go to a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal all of it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why let the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the final ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there &apos;s always something that remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
he repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt internally displaced and wonder@@ ed why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I issued the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by ensu@@ ing death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court rendered pen@@ alties for life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ opinion : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped in June 1976 with his pregnant woman and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
in 1995 , Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
edited the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnessed a particularly un@@ successful translation in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the jap@@ an@@ ese word , which &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with evil rear @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; was translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
edited the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could there be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the invalid English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture Police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed about the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved nationwide in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 failures of sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors brought 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the particularly un@@ named repor@@ ter published comments to the light published on Yahoo &apos;s Yahoo list , which show the prejudi@@ ces of some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on the translation error on Yahoo received the following comments among others :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , doesn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ is@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations in their company . then , the Japanese employee whose English knowledge is considered the best translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases , created by machine translation , show that this technique can still not be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large corporations or by the government , who have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto , hopefully , uses a more rep@@ utable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
home page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by opposition groups opposing the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ reh@@ ended and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ ith : activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an organizations are re @-@ locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay offers Internet access at the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that this is still more favourable than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO , Vega , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds wrong@@ ly or refuses the request when calling a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get an education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other cri@@ adi@@ ans exactly how they became victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of structural design .
the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by Mu@@ eller , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ ta in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school can be called Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , as the feeling of gratitude which cri@@ adi@@ ta is inj@@ ected guarantees generally silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family that their daughter believes in the belief that they are able to complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they even never know about it .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an official in the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra took a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour power ; they also live isolated by other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
and they went all further to the synagogue .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the home of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
Friday , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time it had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the manager Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read leading edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host found someone listening to while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would once again study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters feared that they would lose the education that they had made possible to lose .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing almost never talked about is har@@ ass@@ ment and har@@ ass@@ ment to which cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians in Paraguay .
the group is headed by Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please announce yourselves .
starting on Monday , if possible .

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to regulate the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law there would then be a place in charge of granting citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could have a punishment of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ er .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a username and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to feed them into a trial .
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committee before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the design &quot; is in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; prot@@ esting &quot; protest .
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza stops in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza loves to show a different side of her country not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North East of Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has yet suffered a nuclear accident , even for this reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the Special Report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after , in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( which are only for this reason , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ f@@ ecture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned replacement units were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from accommodation establishments ( such as cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , we are still trying to res@@ ett@@ le to final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ ces who were living after the disaster in accommodation establishments were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 1,@@ 0@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the land used in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 ac@@ res of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is lag@@ ging far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to establish a general picture , the newspaper caused a large number of surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and also how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed believe that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
as it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also raised its attention to the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
about 16@@ 0,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses .
at the end of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centers are older than 50 years old . they are known to return to proper dwell@@ ings because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more link than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had hit him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ ana ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video captured by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are shortly pointing to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also emerged in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times into social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was accused of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group were killed , after being attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a head@@ stock .
police interventions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber stories and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers all over the country .
once again , the bra@@ zi@@ lian media have tu@@ cked off road protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo pur@@ pos@@ efully reported about a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photograph .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Un@@ de@@ du@@ str@@ alization of For@@ gotten L@@ ands in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uted daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a subject of concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , sugar prices rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ van@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
during the following years the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane mills came , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over@@ turned and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , which he helped to build .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace generator has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to gr@@ asp@@ ire , they also stopped acceler@@ ating the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a bearing person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
at the age of 65 , N@@ ene is reti@@ ring , not because he lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording a song by Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with the permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it using Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop begins with the participation of young participants in conversation subjects such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ aro@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were van@@ ished or murdered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t necessarily master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in Um@@ schrift , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will take our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
so they can do what the Creator has appointed
in the comment section , readers and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ic ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for this reason ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( as well as &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i there are a variety of small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger Ma@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic courts , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Sal@@ mon is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition there are Rei@@ s@@ b@@ älle ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand @-@ made belts made of dried salmon .
you can watch other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i , which is devoted to supplying the restaurant industry , for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the ma@@ sts and gh@@ ost@@ s regularly appear in statistics , but these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime can not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear changed life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing ourselves for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on October 13 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership .
the project is based on stories written by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being &quot; s@@ wat@@ ered . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was pill@@ aged by threats , &quot; describing how the armed criminals press money from their business month by month , until they had destroyed the business in the end , but also tore their family apart .
you think of all that you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
I asked myself if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , ro@@ ast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez was missing .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand innocent words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) V@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a horri@@ ble accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate event@@ ual trage@@ dies that occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what Happ@@ ened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country was neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people who looked at the World Cup .
houses scattered and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was identified several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an settlements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Res@@ ident towards Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
even one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely inter@@ rupt the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a recent announcement published by the United Nations , those who escaped could strike blows , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ an to this statement , but had not associated with it the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these wrong coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries based on which page they were published . by doing so , we want to show the reach more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked together ) several examples can be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the orange card ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that caused rum@@ ors to be found was that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not only mention fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions relating to the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( Nigeria b@@ ans the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in northern Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ wear after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre as this one who used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax bu@@ ster , who refu@@ te this .

this article draws attention to the continuing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but cited the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express was not included at the time of publication of our article .
Greece , 2012 .
you are talking about the cartridge &quot; τ@@ ρ@@ ο@@ φ@@ ή &quot; ( warning ! ) !
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nicar@@ agu@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of Stu@@ dents of The@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was presented as evidence of the bom@@ bing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ ve the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a correction to what it was seen as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which only appeared in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ours that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and are used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to argue that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and ander@@ g@@ oni@@ um ( which is often spread by Burma nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phantom Luxury Carnival ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar managed to have Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catholic @-@ standing news site An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar &quot; j@@ ih@@ adi attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo turned up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and over 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting vis @-@ à @-@ vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message , allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussions like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the message containing the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps do exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame foc@@ usses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investigated how forci@@ ble media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons using CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. conf@@ using ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ inci@@ ble words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese so@@ da ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - strive for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The ease or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you get war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they de@@ generate other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the banks .
after a response from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster of May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missed because of the floods and slu@@ dge .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were transported to 304 secure places of residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ ets provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ding ag@@ grav@@ ates the crisis of Den@@ gue , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ o@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and a further five will be completed to transport emergency deliveries to residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the disaster centre .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ en@@ storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , allowing users to call a vehicle to pick up help and donations , and they were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flood and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need into security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
the Muslims , which one cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend .
I have trusted in her my four years old daughter , she trusted in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the last minute we call on slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next one we can@@ alize rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they had to cope with me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice different religions .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim &apos;s drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as I do not fit into it , Muslims have to be de@@ fi@@ gured .
to be lim@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western conception the religion Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in the world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims that have colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ sec@@ ted the story behind these images .
but these pictures stand still further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous scar@@ ring dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative sh@@ ad@@ dens the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries during the last three decades , while the US in 2016 couldn &apos;t even elect their first female candidate .
this narrative is failing to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks at the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
usage approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan had re@@ designed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ voc@@ able Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we do not carry all the T@@ ash@@ k@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the running tape by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that our already flaw@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger who swe@@ ars the head@@ sc@@ arf to a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it attacks our identity so far , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
usage approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
usage approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as they gain decades ago a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which established a company with the name of Hon@@ our Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God the only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
usage approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan reserved for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family dominated by India , which he could not close in half a century into his arms .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bomb of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time , the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir grave of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to be part of my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across the continent from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to ch@@ ase weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy comes home to the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this duality establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that it bombs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we reject upon Muslim lands .
due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participated in a scientifically sound picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deep dar@@ ing to un@@ veil the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous expression that we are ste@@ aling in our news @-@ editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives wishing to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason why conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me today an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread cr@@ umb in my speech .
things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may lie where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the Berkeley Bridge , conversations took place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enth@@ used by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago was even scientific of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously consoli@@ date the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we don &apos;t have a president who feeds into broken countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and un@@ seen 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages cannot be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events , instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to , feel , soci@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also took the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the tale of the bun@@ ni@@ es and the Bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his fork , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara is asked : &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative guides .
Puerto Rico claims of the US to re@@ establish sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the American Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad stream@@ lining of state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Gu@@ ards for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers appreciate the work of the missing Syrian developer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo of the Facebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Study ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who participate in the movements for free knowledge have worked alongside side to look over the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken possession of a strict secret ordered by the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his residence and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here ancient Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything about it , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .

N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually having one in their hands .

it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison crowds
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes fail to say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...

I am persu@@ ading myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison according to the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption @-@ condemned director following port release again on previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence , in which the corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was held by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many people do not welcome the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the wrong@@ do@@ er .
the company apparently remained silent and did not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after being sentenced to prison and half of whom had been served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is willingly paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ ed !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says that the director had no mor@@ als whatsoever :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so well rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora &apos;s prison . the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ der and - by the way , proph@@ etic or@@ ators .
one of his most famous verbal represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics but he does not turn from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was sitting for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he dis@@ mis@@ ses mon@@ ies , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Flash@@ mo@@ ury . ( @ a@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored a lot of users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ amm@@ ers .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the Internet , because they contained the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the people in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for its use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ itted A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze and control the post by checking the words next .
for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not comply with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have prohibited such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied post@@ ings .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would make them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of bank@@ rupt@@ cy among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately not writing the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have risen .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is supposed to intensi@@ fy violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the out@@ pac@@ ed hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running more in context than on code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now at 18 .
prior to this change in the marriage network , some of the members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a large public out@@ cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Central Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements committed to aboli@@ shing laws for children followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children of children was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one on the other .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on children had finally been changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a member of the minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk which disgu@@ ises the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel had the opinion that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the Act had been adopted .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
folders M@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ bearing age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the design for the change of the married network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians who were entitled to vote have voted in favour of the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # sea @-@ marri@@ ages .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to take legal action , and the law should be passed and he seems to deliver his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was legitimate when Mahar@@ aj ple@@ aded against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of addressing the problem , would suggest that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , would then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright laws in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has now closed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many technical Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Wikipedia articles since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blo@@ gs of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are resur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia articles on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( thus calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ators ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .com , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ator at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the query to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ c@@ len@@ ess r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
that motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to shoot pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know it , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he gaz@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days , mostly living in a tent to make shots of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take photos of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist lod@@ g@@ ings .
see below some of these photos .

years after marriage , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoided with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a was judged by a false tri@@ bunal and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and dedicated to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who do not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women could easily identify with .
not utter@@ ing the names of their hus@@ bands al@@ oud , is a custom that they all legally uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , that means they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
shouldn &apos;t it be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from Wal@@ he village in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she only ch@@ oo@@ ed herself ; another decided to release the whole bunch of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a student &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation ended in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that indicates married status :
why must women only show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at each discussion club we make a trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , for example as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine cour@@ ta , a wide shirt above a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own choice of clothes , the mor@@ ale ties with the sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed Roh@@ ini put her own pair of Cur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini are sure they &apos;ll manage it .
to the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and are no other members of the family .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the slip by more freedom of movement or one &apos;s own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as explained by Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan by the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year the h@@ ash@@ tag had been lined up by the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan applies as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese twist .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese mid@@ schools .
the beat of the Beat@@ les survived all .
today is The Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can &apos;t be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beat@@ les memorial day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and walked across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are there !
follow the h@@ ash@@ tag , lined up , to learn more about the Beat@@ les memorial day .
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be attacked in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald men for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , which is the target of murder for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to undertake a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who were planning to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique , men of bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police after the latest murder of three bald men because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the District of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ une in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the deaths of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald men for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty faced by Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ME fo@@ ams A country in which people would have shame to go on the streets , attract sex to good sheet music , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people would not hurt or even steal their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed are hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ani , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both glorious :
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald men .

in November 2015 , Bas@@ que &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who had claimed responsibility as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death but gave no further information .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of det@@ ained Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China describes Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to allow treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year , and only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u , as she announced in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s invitation attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told her that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go to proper medical care . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources were reported in Beijing by the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P beforehand that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says on :
Canada is calling on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
in an explanation on 29 June , the French Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan to Taiwan
the Council of land@@ land@@ ings in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual gur@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn has contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... nobody has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , abandon the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given last week by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ responses .
he tar@@ red the corresponding questions with non @-@ responses ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that he was paid highly to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing its comment on the blog , he points out critics concerning the critics that you should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that is right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ appro@@ ve a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a wrong speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ur@@ ans make their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine expands to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I then reply . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook internally against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little difference between Can@@ adi@@ ans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag very visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health system !
there are no guns with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau em@@ bed the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just nice .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend makes him .
although not specifically political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand establishes a strict law against &quot; read Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that purchasing would be unnecessary and a waste of tax ev@@ asion .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before they get into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the unc@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup fo@@ es during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ mac@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , write @-@ off , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ stor@@ eyed residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard for him to quit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbi@@ ds us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in the winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when we are on holiday , we visit ourselves .
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Ukraine , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia didn &apos;t break away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains re@@ vil@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for each child , Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 child allowance .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day that the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure authenticity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ th year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on their way through .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - however , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , tells Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have slept on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work place .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to take the next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors travelers consult their phones cal@@ m@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she smo@@ kes in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with afri@@ can hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me briefly .
&quot; Ya se Fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also used the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat Group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital orship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , afflicted ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet , based on Twitter , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checking out whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest of the population .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the mainland China &quot; ( as a result of this article ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government departments , authorities and institutions connected to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when they operate their computers and communications equipment .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole host of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything that matters is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has desc@@ ended into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even when the Earth shifts on to the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister put it , with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
all the districts sought , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
during the third night things had a bit cal@@ med after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice ring@@ ing through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me . we alli@@ ed us to a magnificent picture that fully fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did was nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have had such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sol@@ itary and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence lies in my nose until now .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months .
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I take all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more det@@ ain@@ ee and I must put myself immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the function@@ ary left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell companion was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
to be a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from a distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it has to be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es catch every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th Sh@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the tra@@ it@@ ors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of vision of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence in order to turn the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ver and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I was used to not answering .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and put@@ ts have become an ordinary communication medium after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing done to earn this punishment .
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you cannot keep your cri@@ es back .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him yet enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find any pleasure in doing so , which is why he was next to an electrically charged stick .
electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went by , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks to his canvas , to his computer , to his couch and again .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ lo@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to far to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not admit it openly , he struggles against U.S. foreign policy as a special a@@ version .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot; so he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ ook the Nes@@ café dissolved in water . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the gn@@ at of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ings of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look at neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior has cancelled the appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening .
the MP and former press spokesperson on the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; precisely &quot; was canc@@ eled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried and true legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la praised the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to advoc@@ ate intellec@@ tuals and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a more and more clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently clou@@ ded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch back to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , Jordan has accepted the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary Crime &quot; - the official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary ministers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that have long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but does not dream of separating his music from politics that is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics was fed up to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or un@@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to later notice that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , who still remains in memory today thanks to his hom@@ opho@@ bic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , such as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically related to the problems rooted in the deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
Jordan has denied Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial kinds of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uch@@ in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uch@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the emis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uch@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari .
I have been looking at Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uch@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another stunning way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sum@@ mer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high caravan was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against scissors and razor blades

external appearance and body care were rare , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate job like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive an apprentices@@ hip in the hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the lecture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel ex@@ po@@ unded ?
this was exactly the question that the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation did not get out of their heads and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la versi@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons round the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in perpet@@ ual fear , and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now record it in its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would unite and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters of Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who will now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN refugee camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo von der Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between them , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him there was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone wrote me something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him and put me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already there was war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how the social injustice on the part of the state exer@@ ted on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never found their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hate those who have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , Archbishop of Cal@@ i :
the Colum@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
in horror , activists witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community as a women &apos;s sword is not only created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published which themati@@ sed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ach@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested pregnant women and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the sexual equ@@ ation of their coun@@ try@@ woman , the hunting on Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States last year .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone I thought was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just about to bring out some shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you flock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything along and scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they asked me , I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster that has not only damaged your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I went to an apartment and a few hours later , a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 was standing under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering me , without having to know anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered with a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you were in security just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about sex equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually effort to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had lunch in the gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there were not very many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were specifically di@@ pped in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in the gun .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria never hurt me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this prob@@ ation period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he spoke not about us per se , but rather about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic increased steadily .
OC Media : which activity do you now pursue ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types .
I don &apos;t pay a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I picked off the type of refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to proph@@ esy with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have which , the Cab@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan , live with men .
you know , many think of Transi@@ ber@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe you change his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all the fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power , and in 1925 took great efforts to end eth@@ ni@@ cal autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs working in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , finished primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired , since Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi must endure , human rights def@@ enders strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of education than men .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms will still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , emo@@ tionally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists have to be silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join as a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking , which refer to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a mixed and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups , which by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and sex . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ hood that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana lik@@ anism : claims to be able to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create rooms in which they can be completely safe and where the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored .
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports in@@ deli@@ bly about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who advoc@@ ates and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil .
the focus of her work lies on neglected , neglected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a Police Commissioner , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the adver@@ ten@@ tious ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez used nothing .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women are to reimbur@@ se an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reporting to law enforcement agencies .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ min@@ ate 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation beats and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 there were 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements were seen .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this are coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as FGM is not a crime in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days die a woman due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should always be regre@@ t@@ ted .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that it happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told her how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long ago from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with mental abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ audi@@ ble legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was chi@@ ef@@ ly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the notification of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a draft law was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # duk@@ es ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law prescri@@ bes to declare Fem@@ ini@@ d an independent criminal act and to punish har@@ ter as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently banned in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to carry at present themselves , if they simply want to report an adver@@ t and get a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as a normal thing .
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are punished .
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ smoke ) reported on the violence wave against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed on the website of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a resolution of the Minister of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned free .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the single sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the insist@@ ent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and det@@ aining human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a tough blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a case of inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the head@@ line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS seized the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information gave the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper on all roads , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of public prohibition and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amounting to 3,000 Nep@@ al@@ ese ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was found guilty of a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5,000 Nep@@ al@@ ese ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month jail term in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the minister of information signed a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again turned against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ani@@ ans are still un@@ willing to end the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the authorities :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman may exercise their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research undertaken by African scientists will help build up own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for the Study of Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched HIV before he decided to go home to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
CC : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being a mach@@ inist .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the US and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
CC : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
CC : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it &apos;s often the limited speed to do things , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed manufacturers change food production worldwide
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ sh@@ ure , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents were not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cr@@ inkl@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer because his work is more and more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to p@@ addle out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far .
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ sh@@ ure in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds they bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds , cross it in order to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasized that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is also known to be threatened by the way that vegetables are bred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it suitable for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or only difficult .
for other plants there are not yet such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Question of View@@ ing
plants are grown in such a way that they have sel@@ ectively desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves , through which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property will be other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ate innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants adjusted to the modified environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do it .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move to international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not profitable or both is the case .
the independent bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be innov@@ ating by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am more than a company with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it really easy in my opinion . &quot;
although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . in order to maintain the seed of traditional vegetable varieties , the centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently a world @-@ wide alliance for open @-@ source seed systems , which is supposed to be the official starting signal for the planned next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid association US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve the seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by by O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is cultivated and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of May 5 , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above .
the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the scor@@ ing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and give victims a voice . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the block@@ age and not to give in . we ins@@ ist on carrying out our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Ägypten : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web sites victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no more access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of articles and articles that he writes for Egypt &apos;s non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the state apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , over@@ charging at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked from 24th May to 6th August 133 pages . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the locking of providers through which Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can act against these acts in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the anti @-@ government organisation Global Justice even sum@@ mon@@ ed the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so published for the detailed report on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for her decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , which devi@@ ates from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a military service in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that , according to the Institute of Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial writes the newspaper further :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
in an article on The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence is a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country , Rio de Janeiro is considered to be &quot; the most violent place in Brazil . &quot; according to statistics from 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an extra belonging to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years .
these security policies include the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit issued by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police command and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a decline in violent death cases . for some years now , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people .
for this calls the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civilian is an im@@ precise point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police captured the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from helicop@@ ters .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege both outside Damascus , leading to the fact that local inhabitants rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional Syrian food produced in Syria and are extremely rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food quality makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expresses his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , you can use the Can@@ Do humanitarian funding platform in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge about the planting of mushrooms , thus Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks distributed in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned alone in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

numerous videos spread across the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal told P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of UFO reports surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction permits are also questioned in locations with a high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had submitted to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity of case to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , continue to spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind .
for these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants were looking for information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by Jo@@ ão P@@ ina &apos;s developer to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the Fo@@ under asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the Tali@@ ban conquest of Afghanistan began .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defe@@ ating the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

CC @-@ 2.0 News
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , he found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees have been shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows in order not to freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high response rates . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - what can happen after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers for months .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ founded sav@@ age helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions .
after having done various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s objectives extend far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of the authority &apos;s decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the final settlement of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by 60 members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP filed a legislative proposal in May where tough@@ er pun@@ ish@@ ments would be introduced to insul@@ t the president or senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such a crime would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , according to the legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , it can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
this would also support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he captured Egyptian polic@@ emen as they demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest delegates , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison line , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , bog@@ us charges of inter alia weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists , H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous event , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists on le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours listening to Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was hear@@ tily inter@@ ro@@ gated to a fully le@@ aked plan of action . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all the illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , sheds light on how the presidential plans seem to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing messages in social media .
the regulations also stipul@@ ate that the registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ mand@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; organis@@ er of the dis@@ semination of information &quot; in the provincial government .
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government has launched a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to provide said services to remove content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court features Sper@@ ling Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications has been blocking the site because it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that works with groups in order to create a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff up
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install secret backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ation companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , consultation is still underway until 19 May . members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
