that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because as a New York Times repor@@ ter he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before any one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed down blu@@ epr@@ ints to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating bre@@ aches and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Council , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on bre@@ aches , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to ris@@ ses .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of being able to fail and to make cracks , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone calls secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail , financial and banking information , his credit balance , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a source of CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ings .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology has been developed by Secure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any form of contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to put away mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to report about mis@@ understand@@ ings in the supply of soldiers and report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who al@@ erts an alarm to the contaminated water by F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street in@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher fol@@ ks and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using to this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states one needs less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and to do this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
it may sound very absurd as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge view into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use legislation to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally stop the transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet store .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed on to@@ e @-@ tops to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moved out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely differently because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust by design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we entr@@ en@@ ched .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked cell phone from your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet touch of panic you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are ?
imagine you have 150 testim@@ oni@@ als , all of which say : &quot; he can hold really well @-@ un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system decisi@@ vely strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence .
it is a little surprising that we trust people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have fewer than three opinions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation creates com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted passion .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one can tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; great art@@ works in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can one create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hurt when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem .
for people are tru@@ sting each other .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know a real thing .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they do not want one to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is going .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of participation conver@@ ge with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a ta@@ vern neighborhood of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would make apartments for one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of isolation and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking places belonging to the government ,
students who were looking for a residence ,
were taught to people whose children had moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs have been started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a foreign or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why does our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that with the components of trust one can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a g@@ ull fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you repres@@ sing yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gl@@ ed with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , questioned and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that anyone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , men j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock was quickly turning into revol@@ t .
why should I do something like that ?
I switched to the television channel and heard ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; close ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember seeing myself -- when we were silent -- as deep as I went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t gather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed there all week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were considered Muslims to be free .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I &apos;ve got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror .
regular visiting of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people from going to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , put her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
one study shows that if people submit messages that have been neg@@ atively reported to Muslims , they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ ings towards Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraqi War and during two periods of election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism , as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming all of us .
in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished youth ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw was restra@@ ined .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m gave an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had encouraged panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people like an exception usually appear , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ p@@ act has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , flying machines reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also build resili@@ ent structures independently .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly away from remote controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one worked .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ in , the mechanically most simple remote @-@ operated flight machine . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , one prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actuators or controller interfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , a lot happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the h@@ edge @-@ starter . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right when all is watching is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ in is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not yet symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one construc@@ ts them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if anything goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- can keep the machine flying even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes round each other in a very remote gal@@ axy , so they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
thirty @-@ nine billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- build a huge laser detector to look for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravity wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically that was the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gravit@@ ational waves from black holes and her through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gravity is a cr@@ ush in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
to illustrate the theory of rel@@ ativity , teachers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ ceful and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite handy , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with tones it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice &apos;s talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally speak the universe .
the gravit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just round : w@@ up@@ p !
spin the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional change of tone . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render the sound &#93; someone who knows what to listen to , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle each hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- cannot be seen .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ a .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light .
with the help of gravit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that things exist in space that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first run which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , upset me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I was chat@@ ting to always playing with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which simultaneously in production are four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so far above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work , so that you understand that I don &apos;t just move around the computer and fanta@@ sies , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
to wear a high tone , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the sum , I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the sum -- when I started working and working with TV production , when I began to work and work , build , create , and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you can not strive differently from size .
the feeling of being no different than striving for great@@ ness no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ming .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more things are at the same time , the more I write history , the more my expectations are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work @-@ ti@@ tan .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the sons of Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ ality ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t really love my job anymore .
the sum did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I simply had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , if you already know the bu@@ zz , who is you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late in it and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ als mo@@ urn , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ds . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens that happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I complain about broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream coming from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing doesn &apos;t seem to me how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful because what a person pre@@ fers to be a home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
none of it is that I am too relaxed .
we gr@@ ate around in the garden , front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I am always cra@@ ving for my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking my te@@ ens daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even at a bad mood !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ ality of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll slice and win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I listen to the tot@@ als . the country that I created , the mar@@ ath@@ ons that I run , the troops , the sums , the sums , the other , the correct sum : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the same sums , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll bring you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in a way that improves neuro@@ logical function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is infected with skull @-@ brain trauma and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save lives it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology instruction that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain rin@@ ds .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ planted them at the close @-@ up point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ integrate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ integrate the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ forgiven we could work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed , they go back home .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ pl@@ ained exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ graf@@ ted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take for@@ age pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we had the motor skills range in the motor@@ ised cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with monkeys .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who picked up spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
see now when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after implantation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
you have to prove first of all that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his grand im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is actually d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are wrong , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ mm@@ ing , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin Top Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations , which , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could carry out the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that the body k@@ ills him .
this is my dis@@ cord with capitalism --
his very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it seized the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of state concerns .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
it is also quickly burned like a candle that lights up very brigh@@ tly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually stopping the economy and expos@@ ing it .
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors who have so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals they feed themselves , that they are therefore star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy which has can@@ ni@@ ated politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and business , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long the economy and politics are separate areas , automation allows the twin peaks to be higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts go deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ car bureaucracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon , some examples .
in the area of the company : imagine a capital market where money is earned while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to it . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world in which we can envis@@ age real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide political together .
it is in our hands and we do it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do it , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not s@@ wir@@ ling , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner the or@@ ator you have very clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it takes place -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , when I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuing den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to run massive , which mas@@ sively threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Area , have continued to den@@ ounce den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change enters , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : which changes do you see ahead of us ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders of finding a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going on through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post@@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will be just as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a snack bar and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the assessment division of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will be .
if your show is judged with nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after you have watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough about what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium bul@@ ge , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t thri@@ ll .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
it requires guaranteed success , so it holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon releases stuff for free , do you intervene , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or re@@ viewing .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give to shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what kind of shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you hit , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the aw@@ ful way of predic@@ ting -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious choices , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help cr@@ ush a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used the data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will then f@@ use it with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have heard in retro@@ sp@@ ect on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
in the end , it &apos;s not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
